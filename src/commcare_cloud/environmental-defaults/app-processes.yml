# Base env containing default values which get
# overridden or added to in each of the specific envs under environments/.
#
# Celery configuration should be broken out by queue. Example:
#
# celery_processes:
#   <host_name>:                # Required; the name of the host on which to put the workers
#     queue_name:               # Required; the comma-separated names of the queue from which each worker configured in this section will consume
#       concurrency: 4          # Required; the concurrency configured on each worker
#       pooling: prefork        # Optional, default prefork; specify prefork or gevent for the process pool type used on each worker in this section
#       max_tasks_per_child: 5  # Optional, only applicable for prefork pooling (corresponds to maxtasksperchild worker command line arg)
#       num_workers: 2          # Optional, default 1; the number of workers to create consuming from this queue on this host
#
# The above celery configuration would create 2 celery workers with max concurrency of 4
# using prefork pooling and a max tasks per child setting of 5, which consume from the
# 'queue_name' queue and both would reside on the 'host_name' machine.
#
# It's ok to create workers on multiple machines as well. For example, adding 'queue_name'
# under a 'host_name_2' section would also create workers on the 'host_name_2' machine
# consuming from the same 'queue_name' queue.
