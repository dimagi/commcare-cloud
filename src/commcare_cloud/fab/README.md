## Deploy Architecture

### Overview

The deploy utilizes symlinks to implement an atomic deploy. This means that during a deploy, we have a folder to build up a release candidate. When that deploy succeeds, we symlink to that release and the webworkers work off that.

In HQ it's implemented with a `releases` folder. In the `releases` folder, there will be another folder with the actual release. An example release will look something like this:
```
www/<env>/releases/2015-09-10_04.00
```
The symlinked directory will be under `current`. 
```
www/<env>/current -> www/<env>/releases/2015-09-10_04.00
```

### Server layout

```
    ~/www/
        This folder contains the code, python environment, and logs
        for each environment (staging, production, etc) running on the server.
        Each environment has its own subfolder named for its evironment
        (i.e. ~/www/staging/log and ~/www/production/log).

    ~/www/<environment>/releases/<YYYY-MM-DD-HH.SS>
        This folder contains a release of commcarehq. Each release has its own
        virtual environment that can be found in `python_env`.

    ~/www/<environment>/current
        This path is a symlink to the release that is being run
        (~/www/<environment>/releases<YYYY-MM-DD-HH.SS>).

    ~/www/<environment>/current/services/
        This contains two subfolders
            /supervisor/
        which hold the configurations for these applications
        for each environment (staging, production, etc) running on the server.
        Theses folders are included in the global /etc/apache2 and
        /etc/supervisor configurations.

## Deploying tips & tricks

### Deploying

To initiate a regular deploy, use the following command:

```
cchq <env> [--control] deploy
```

Sometimes deploys fail intermittently. If a deploy fails, you can resume a deploy by running the following command:

```
cchq <env> [--control] deploy:resume=yes
```

In the event that a deploy completes successfully and many errors start appearing, you can rollback the release to the previous version:

```
fab <env> rollback
```

### Private releases

The case may arise where you need to setup a new release, but do not want to do a full deploy. For example, this is often used when you would want to run a new management command that was just merged. To do this run:
```
cchq <env> fab setup_release
```

This will create a release with the most recent master code and a new virtualenv. Just cd into the directory that
is printed on the screen and run your command, or use `django-manage` with the `--release=<NAME>` parameter.

To set up a release based on a non-master branch, run:

```
cchq <env> fab setup_release --set code_branch=<HQ BRANCH>
```

Upon deploys, releases like these are cleaned up by the deploy process. If you know you have a long running command, you can ensure that the release does not get removed by using the `keep_days` option:

```
cchq <env> fab setup_release:keep_days=10
```

This will keep your release around for at least 10 days before it gets removed by a deploy.

### Task list

To get a list of possible tasks to run, use `cchq <env> fab -l`. Here is an abbreviated list of useful commands you can run:

```
clean_releases         Cleans old and failed deploys from the ~/www/<environment>/releases/ directory
deploy                 Preindex and deploy if it completes quickly enough, otherwise abort
force_update_static
hotfix_deploy          deploy ONLY the code with no extra cleanup or syncing
manage                 run a management command
preindex_views         Creates a new release that runs preindex_everything. Clones code from
restart_services
rollback               Rolls back the servers to the previous release if it exists and is same
setup_release          Setup a release in the releases directory with the most recent code.
start_pillows
stop_pillows
supervisorctl
```

## Code architecture

The deploy code attempts to adhere to the following philosophies when adding tasks/functionality to it.

`fab/operations` - These files will include "operations" which are sets of commands to be run on certain machines. You should see `@roles` in these files, but no `@task` decorators.

`fab/fabfile.py` - These should just be tasks. Tasks will be made up of a composition of "operations". Ideally, tasks should never call other tasks.
