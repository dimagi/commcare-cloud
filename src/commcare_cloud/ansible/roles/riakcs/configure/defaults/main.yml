# Possible values for riak_backend
#
# - "leveldb"
#   The default, use this unless you know you need something different.
#   Requires less RAM, lower performance.
#
# - "bitcask"
#   All keys must fit in RAM. Higher performance, but requires more RAM. Uses
#   a LOT more disk space possibly due to bitcask not using compression.
#
# - "leveldb-bad-config"
#   Bad leveldb configuration. We're slowly migrating away from this, but the
#   migration requires reading each object from the old cluster and saving
#   it in a new cluster.
#   http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2017-March/019142.html
#   This configuration uses by far the least disk space. Would be cool if a
#   change could be made to riak to support this configuration and eliminate
#   the (low) chance of data loss that it apparently has.
