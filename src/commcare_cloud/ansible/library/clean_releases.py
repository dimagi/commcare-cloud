short_description: Delete old releases.

description: Delete old releases, but retain the current release, files
    that are not directories, directories in the "exclude" list, any
    releases that contain a "KEEP_UNTIL__%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M" file where the
    UTC date in the filename is in the future, as well as the most
    recent "keep" (default 2) releases, proiritizing those that contain
    a ".build-complete" file. Releases are sorted in reverse by name to
    determine recency. The "exclude" releases do not count toward the
    "keep" releases, however the "current" release does count if it is
    not explicitly excluded.
