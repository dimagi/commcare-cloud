  The {{pillow_name.name}} on {{environment.name}} has been above{{#is_warning}} {{warn_threshold}} {{/is_warning}}{{#is_alert}} {{threshold}} {{/is_alert}}for the past minute.
  If this is a pillow rewind, you can solve by finding a couch change seq from before it happened (pick ids from /commcarehq/_changes?descending=true with revs starting with "1-" until you find a form with received_on with an early enough time, and then use the corresonding seq) and use a few lines like https://gist.github.com/dannyroberts/fdd07ecd780e08b6c236092379535a82 in `django-mange shell` to reset the checkpoint to the seq you found.
