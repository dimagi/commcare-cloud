# Contributing to CommCare-Cloud

CommCare-Cloud is chiefly developed by Dimagi, but we welcome contributions,
whether it be new tools, simplifications, or documentation improvements.

Before making any commits, make sure you install the git hooks:

```
./git-hooks/install.sh
```

This will make sure you never commit an unencrypted vault.yml file.


## Running tests

To run tests, first install the test dependencies

```
pip install -e .[test]
```

and then run

```
nosetests
```

Tests include tests of your own specific environments dir.


## Updating the `requirements.txt`

Dependencies are added to `setup.py`. Dependencies that don't fall neatly into
"install_requires" and "tests_require", which is rare, should go into a
`requirements-*.in` file. Dependencies in `setup.py` and `requirements-*.in`
should be unpinned, or if there is a known range of compatibility, it should be
constrained by an upper and/or lower limit as appropriate.

`requirements.txt` is then autogenerated using `pip-compile` (from `pip-tools`)
and the contains the exact pinned versions you might expect from running `pip
freeze`.

To update requirements.txt to the latest available versions of python libraries,
install `pip-tools`

```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

and then run

```bash
make requirements
```
