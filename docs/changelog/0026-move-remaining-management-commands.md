# 26. Move remaining management commands explicitly

**Date:** 2019-08-21

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
This change requires editing `app-processes.yml` to add some of processes to the `management_comamnds`
section

## Details
To standardize how we deploy all management command processes we have changed the remaining management commands
to use the same process as the others. The following commands used to be automatically deployed as part of the
pillowtop processes and would always be deployed onto the first host in the `pillowtop` group. From now on they
will be deployed as configured by the `management_commands` section in `app-processes.yml`.

* run_pillow_retry_queue

## Steps to update
1. Add the above mentioned management command to the `management_commands` section of `app-processes.yml`:

```diff
  management_commands:
+   pillowN:
+     run_pillow_retry_queue:
```
2. Run `cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs`
