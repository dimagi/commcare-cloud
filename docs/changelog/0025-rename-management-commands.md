# 25. Rename management commands explicitly

**Date:** 2019-08-20

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
This change requires editing `app-processes.yml` to rename some of the processes in the `management_comamnds`
section

## Details
To simplify the mapping of management commands to process names we have renamed two of the commands to match
the actual Django management command names:

* sms_queue -> run_sms_queue
* submission_reprocessing_queue -> run_submission_reprocessing_queue

## Steps to update
1. Change any references to the old management command names to the new name in `app-processes.yml`
2. Run `cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs`
