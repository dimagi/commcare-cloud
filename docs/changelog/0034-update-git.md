# 34. Update git to the latest version

**Date:** 2020-04-16

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Due to a [high-severity security advisory](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q) on the popular version control software program `git`,
observing security best practices dictates upgrading to one of the git versions designated as "Patched"
such as 2.26.1.

## Details
CommCare Cloud uses `git` to update CommCare code from the central repository to each machine
that needs the code. There is no known attempt to exploit the above vulnerability in any CommCare environment,
nor is there a known direct procedue for exploiting it in a CommCare environment. However, security best practices
dictate preemptive action.

## Steps to update
To update git on all machines in your environment run

1. Update git to the latest version
```bash
cchq <env> deploy-stack --tags=install_git
```

2. Make sure the version is one of the "Patched" versions in the hyperlink above, such as 2.26.1.
```bash
cchq <env> run-shell-command all 'git --version'
```
Output should looks something like
```
x.x.x.x | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
git version 2.26.1
y.y.y.y | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
git version 2.26.1
...
```
