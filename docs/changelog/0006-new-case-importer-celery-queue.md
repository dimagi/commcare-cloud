# 6. New Case Importer Celery Queue

**Date:** 2018-11-20

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
CommCare versions beyond this commit require this change to function correctly:
[bc07919f](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/bc07919f38828306015c688469a35df2fd8f9527)


## Change Context
Importing cases is often a time-sensitive task, and prolonged backlogs are
very visible to users.  It will be useful to have a separate queue
specifically for case imports, to improve visibility into backups as well as
typical runtimes.  Additionally, this is a first step towards allocating
resources specifically for case imports, should that become necessary.

## Details
This creates a case_import_queue in celery, which will be used for case
import tasks.

## Steps to update
This update should be performed before updating CommCare to a version more
recent than that specified above.

First, add a queue called `case_import_queue` to your app_processes.yml,
following the examples in commcare-cloud commit 1b602e805.

To apply this change, run

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs
```
