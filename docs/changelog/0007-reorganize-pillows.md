**Date:** 2018-11-26

## CommCare Version Dependency
This version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[44615b3a](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/44615b3a1eea823dc01a09c9809adae0b0f29812)


## Change Context
Pillows read changes from kafka and do various processing such as sending them to
elasticsearch, transforming into a UCR table row etc. A doc for same change is read
multiple times for each processor, since there are separte pillows for each processor.
This is inefficient, so we have combined multiple processors that apply for a
given document type (also called `KAFKA_TOPIC`) such as form/case/user under
one pillow. For e.g. A new single `case-pillow` pillow replaces
various old pillows that process case changes such as `CaseToElasticsearchPillow`,
`CaseSearchToElasticsearchPillow`, `ReportCaseToElasticsearchPillow`,
and `kafka-ucr-main` etc. 

## Details
This change replaces old pillows with new pillows. New pillows start
processing at the oldest change of all of old pillows to ensure all changes
are processed by all processors. Because of this, initially some changes may be 
reprocessed for some processors, so it will be prudent to make sure that there is
no large difference in checkpoints between the pillows to be reorganized.
This can be checked by dry running step 3 of update steps below at anytime which
prints checkpoints of the pillows to be reorganized.

Exact pillow reorganization is as per below.

Old Pillow | New Pillow

CaseToElasticsearchPillow | case-pillow
CaseSearchToElasticsearchPillow | case-pillow
kafka-ucr-static | case-pillow, xform-pillow, user-pillow

## Steps to update
Ensure that you have deployed a version of CommCare later than the version mentioned above
and that none of pillows for a given document type are too far behind from each other.

1. Replace old pillows with new pillows in pillow section of your app_processes.yml
   Here's an example [pull request](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/2415)
   Do not merge this until the switch is fully complete. Make sure you create enough
   processes to handle your current load.
2. Stop all pillows. You may have to be on above git branch (for e.g. pillow-reorg)
```bash   
cchq <env> fab stop_pillows --branch=pillow-reorg
```
3. Run below django management command to create checkpoints for new pillows.
```bash   
cchq <env> django-manage create_checkpoints_for_merged_pillows
```
You can pass `--check` option to dry-run which prints checkpoint info.
You can also pass `--cleanup-first` which deletes new checkpoints created during
multiple runs of this command.
4. Deploy the change so that supervisor configuration is updated for the pillow switch.
```bash   
cchq <env> ap deploy_commcarehq.yml --tags=services --limit=pillowtop --branch=pillow-reorg
```
5. Run below command so that the supervisor process rereads the new config
```bash   
cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs --branch=pillow-reorg
```
6. Finally start all pillows.
```bash    
cchq <env> fab start_pillows --branch=pillow-reorg
```

If all goes well, then the switch to new pillows is complete.
You may do below checks to make sure the change is deployed succesfully.

1. Do `cchq <env> service pillowtop status` and make sure that new pillows are running succesfully and old pillows are not.
2. Look at pillow logs for new pillows and make sure there are no errors.
3. Do basic QA of various change feeds like
   - Submit few forms, and make sure they appear in the UCR and standard reports
   - Create few mobile workers and make sure they are searchable in report filters
4. Keep an eye on https://your-domain/hq/admin/pillow_errors/ and pillow section of
   https://your-domain/hq/admin/system/

At this point if all goes well, the above PR can be merged.

If anything goes wrong beyond repair, the change can be rolled back by repeating
all of above steps but using master branch in place of
your pillow-reorg branch (the third step can be skipped).
