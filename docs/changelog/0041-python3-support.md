# 41. Add support for Python 3

**Date:** 2021-01-11

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Python 3 is supported and now the preferred version to use. In anticipation of dropping Python 2 support,
an error will be genereated if running commands with Python 2. Instructions for upgrading to Python 3,
as well as continuing to use Python 2 are provided in the error message.

## Details
Pip versions greater than 21.0 are not compatible with Python 2. To avoid dependency issues,
we urge you to upgrade your environment to Python 3 as soon as possible. Python 2 should only
serve as a backup if any issues are encountered while using Python 3.

## Steps to update
Setup Python 3
- Create a new Python-3-based virtualenv (3.6 recommended)
- Run `pip install -r requirements3.txt`
- Run `pip install -e .`
- Run `rm src/commcare_cloud.egg-info/requires.txt`
- Run `manage-commcare-cloud install`

To use Python 2, append this flag to your command:
`--force-commcare-cloud-to-use-python2`
