# 41. Dropping support for Python 2

**Date:** 2021-01-11

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Python 3.6 is supported and now the preferred version to use. In anticipation
of dropping Python 2 support, an error will be displayed when running commands
with Python 2. Instructions for upgrading to Python 3 are provided in the
error message. An option is provided to temporarily revert to Python 2 (see
update steps for details).

Python 2 support will end on 2021-03-04.

## Details
Pip versions greater than 21.0 are not compatible with Python 2. To avoid
dependency issues, we urge you to upgrade your environment to Python 3.6 as
soon as possible. Python 2 should only serve as a backup if any issues are
encountered while using Python 3.

## Steps to update
Setup Python 3
- Create a new Python-3.6-based virtualenv
- Run `pip install -r requirements3.txt`
- Run `pip install -e .`
- Run `rm src/commcare_cloud.egg-info/requires.txt`
- Run `manage-commcare-cloud install`

If you encounter a problem using Python 3, you can temporarily revert back to
Python 2 by activating a Python 2 virtualenv and appending this option to your
command: `--force-commcare-cloud-to-use-python2`.

You can ensure your Python 2 virtualenv has all of the latest requirements by
running the above setup commands with the Python 2 virtualenv activated,
except replace `requirements3.txt` with `requirements.txt`.
