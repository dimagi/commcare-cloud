# 23. Upgrade to Python 3

**Date:** 2018-07-18

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[476e3291](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/476e32910bf757d950b2575423c043bd71e83a48)


## Change Context
This change installs Python 3.6.8, builds a new virtualenv, and runs
CommCare HQ in Python 3.

## Details
CommCare HQ will drop support for Python 2 on August 22, 2019.
Performing these steps will ensure that your environment will be able
to receive updates at that date.

## Steps to update
1. Set `py3_include_venv` in `fab-settings.yml` to `True`. See this
[example](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/2906/commits/e56a5ce47b3a902f8aefad8ee5b53d2a7afca504).
2. Install Python 3 requirements
```bash
commcare-cloud <env> ap deploy_common.yml --tags=common_installs
```
3. Add Python 3 virtualenv
```bash
cchq <env> ansible-playbook deploy_commcarehq.yml --tags=py3 -e 'CREATE_NEW_VIRTUALENV=1'
```
4. Update Python processes to use Python 3
```bash
cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs
```
5. Restart services to ensure services are run in Python 3.
```bash
cchq <env> fab restart_services
```
6. [Optional] To run management commands in Python 3 when using `cchq <env> django-manage`,
set `py3_run_deploy` in `fab-settings.yml` to `True`.
