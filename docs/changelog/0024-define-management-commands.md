# 24. Define management commands explicitly

**Date:** 2019-07-17

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
This change requires changing app-processes.yml to include a list of management comamnds to run

## Details
Previously some management commands were configured to run continuously based on the servers that
a celery process was running on. Now the management commands are explicitly defined in
app-processes.yml.

## Steps to update
1. Add the following line to app-processes.yml
```yaml
management_commands:
```

2. For any host that is running `sms_queue` in `celery_processes`, create an entry under management_commands:
```yaml
management_commands:
  server_hostname:
    sms_queue:
```

3. For any host that is running `reminder_queue` in `celery_processes`, create an entry under management_commands:
```yaml
management_commands:
  server_hostname:
    handle_survey_actions:
    queue_schedule_instances:
```

4. For any host that is running `submission_reprocessing_queue` in `celery_processes`, create an entry under management_commands:
```yaml
management_commands:
  server_hostname:
    submission_reprocessing_queue:
```

5. Run `cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs`
