# 33. Update `deploy` CommandArgs

**Date:** 2020-02-28

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
We are adding support for deploying from a specific commit hash or tag, replacing
the deploy command's `commcare-branch` argument with a more general `commcare-rev` argument.

## Details
We previously supported deploying only from named branches. This change enables more control
over which code is deployed for users who do not have the ability to create branches.

## Steps to update
The only change you need to make is to replace any usage of
`commcare-cloud <env> fab deploy --commcare-branch=BRANCH` with
`commcare-cloud <env> fab deploy --commcare-rev=BRANCH`.
