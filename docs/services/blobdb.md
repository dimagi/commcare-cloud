## Usage in CommCare

The BlobDB refers to the internal service used by CommCare to store binary data or [blobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object).
The interal API is abstracted from the backend service allowing different backends to be used. Currently supported
backends are:

* File system
  - This backend is used for small CommCare deployments where all CommCare services can be run on a single VM / server.
* S3 compatible service (S3, OpenStack Swift, Minio, Riak CS etc.) 
  - For larger deployments an Object Storage service is required to allow access to the data from different VMs.

The BlobDB is made up of 2 components:

* PostgreSQL metadata store
  - This keeps track of the object key and it's association to the relevant CommCare models.
* Key based storage service
  - This the actual service where the data is stored. Data can be retrieved by using the object key.

Examples of data that is stored in the BlobDB:

* Form XML
* Form attachments e.g. images
* Application multimedia
* Data exports
* Temporary downloads / uploads

## Migrating from one BlobDB backend to another
It is possible to migrate from one backend to another. The process is described in the following documents:

- [Migrate from one S3 backend to another](blobdb/migrate-s3-to-s3.md)
- [Migrate from File System backend to S3 backend](blobdb/migrate-fs-to-s3.md)
