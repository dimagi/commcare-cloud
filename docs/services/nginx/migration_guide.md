#### Migrating Nginx
1.  Install and configure nginx on the new node
    *   Add the server in inventory and assign it the `proxy` group and `cas_proxy`(For ICDS)
    *   Run `commcare-cloud <env> ap deploy_shared_dir.yml --tags=nfs --limit=shared_dir_host`
    *   Run `commcare-cloud <env> ansible-playbook letsencrypt_cert.yml`
    *   Run `deploy-stack` for the server.
    *   Do a deploy `cchq <env> deploy`

2.  Ensure that any files being served directly by nginx are present and identical to the files on the current node
    *   Copy static content from live proxy `/home/cchq/www/<env>/current/staticfiles` to new server
    *   Copy any other static site content from the live proxy

    *   Setup SSL certificates
        *   Copy Letsencrypt Configuration dir from live proxy `/etc/letsencrypt` to new server
3.  QA
    *   Do a test if it's working by editing local `/etc/hosts` file.

4.  Switch traffic to the new proxy.

5.  Post steps
    *   Replace the old server with the new server in the `staticfiles` inventory group.
    *   Confirm that the SSL certificate can be renewed correctly by running `certbot renew --dry-run`
    *   Run a code deploy to ensure that the CommCare staticfile process is working correctly with the new proxy.
