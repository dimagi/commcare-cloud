# Hosting Considerations

If you are interested in running a CommCare server environment there are a
number of serious obstacles to consider before taking the plunge. If you are
already managing a CommCare server environment and are finding it challenging,
you may also find thinking about the considerations listed here helpful before
deciding your next steps.


## CommCare Cluster Management

CommCare HQ is a complex, distributed software application, made up of dozens of
processes and several pieces of third-party open source database software. It
has been built for scale rather than simplicity, and as a result even for small
deployments a CommCare server or server cluster can be challenging to maintain.

### Many processes

While the setup automation should work out of the box, once you're up and
running you will have to troubleshoot any issues yourself. This means being
familiar enough with every piece of third-party database software to be able to
debug issues and bring it back to life or recover from some other bad state; it
also means understanding what each of the many types of CommCare application
processes does well enough to troubleshoot issues.

CommCare HQ relies on the following open source technologies:

- PostgreSQL
  - PL/Proxy and a custom sharding setup
  - `pg_backup` and streaming replication
- CouchDB
- Redis
- Riak/Riak CS (mandatory for multi-server environments)
- Elasticsearch
- Kafka (and Zookeeper)
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx

CommCare HQ also employs different types of application processes each with its
own distinct purpose and set of functionality:

- Web workers
- Asynchronous task processors (Celery)
- [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) processes
  ("Pillowtop") that themselves come in a number of different flavors and fill a
  number of different roles
- The CommCare mobile engine exposed as a webservice ("Formplayer")

You will also need some familiarity with the following sysadmin tools:

- Monit
- Supervisor
- Ansible
- Fabric
- EcryptFS
- [LVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29) (optional)


## Physical Server Management

This section is for people interested in owning the physical hardware running
their servers. If you will be using an established data center or modern hosting
provider, this doesn't apply.

It can be tempting to want to run CommCare HQ on server hardware that you own.
After all, a server is just a computer connected to the internet, with enough
RAM, CPU, and Disk to run the software it's hosting. However, in practice,
there's a lot more that goes into it.

### Network Connection

One of the biggest difficulties in maintaining physical server hardware is that
to be reliable it must **always** be connected to the internet over a stable and
reliable network. In many of the areas of the world that are most interested in
self-hosting for data-sovereignty reasons, network connectivity is notoriously
spotty. Real data centers will go to great lengths to keep their servers always
connected to the public internet, including network redundancy. It can be close
to impossible to do this at the level of one or two servers in an office, so in
practice, these servers will experience large rates of downtime.

### Power Source

Another often-overlooked challenge with managing physical hardware is
maintaining a reliable power source. In many areas of the world that use
CommCare, reliable power is not a given. Even with a generator, unless there's a
sophisticated battery backup system in place, it will take a number of seconds
for the generator to kick in, and even the slightest blip in power supply will
cause a server to shut off without warning. Thus, without a well-planned system
in place for maintaining consistent power even through a grid outage, these
servers will experience a lot of downtime and will be at risk for data
corruption as a result of powering off without warning.

### Physical Security

Real data centers are highly guarded by security personnel and have
authorization protocols preventing physical access to the servers except by a
small handful of entrusted individuals. With physical access to a machine, a
malicious or unwitting person can steal private information or cause untold
damage including deletion of all data. In the typical office environment,
maintaining an appropriate level of physical security around the hardware is not
a given, and will require concerted effort and planning.

### Temperature Control

Computer hardware gives off a tremendous amount of heat. Servers are **hot**,
and so are many of the areas of the world that use CommCare. Real data centers
are carefully designed to manage heat flow and sites are often specifically
chosen for environmental features such as cold outdoor temperature or proximity
to a vast water source for cooling. Overheating is a very real issue and when it
happens it will lead to unpredictable hardware failure.
