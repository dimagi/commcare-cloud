Deploy CommCare HQ
==================

This section has details on the following topics.

- How to deploy a CommCare HQ instance on one or more servers
  (also referred to as "install" sometimes).

- :doc:`Preparatory steps <preparing-to-migrate>` for migrating from
  another environment such as Dimagi's www.commcarehq.org.

- Import data if you are migrating from another existing instance such
  as Dimagi's www.commcarehq.org or any other
  using :ref:`migrate-project`.

- A :ref:`go-live-checklist` and :ref:`basic QA tests <new-env-qa>` to
  make sure everything is working well before making your instance live
  to the public.

Once you have understood what deployment option is most suitable for you
using :ref:`deployment-options` guide and have all
the :ref:`prerequisites <hosting-prereqs>` to deploy you can go ahead
and deploy CommCare HQ! You can follow one of the deployment guides
below depending on the type of deployment option that's suitable for
you.

1. :ref:`quick-install`: This tutorial helps you install CommCare HQ on
   a single machine with an install wizard. Most of the install is done
   automatically with configuration set to sensible defaults. This is
   useful to quickly get started, test or preview what's involved in a
   working CommCare HQ environment.

2. :ref:`cchq-manual-install`: This tutorial helps you install CommCare
   HQ on a single machine or a small cluster
   using :ref:`prereqs/7-commcare-cloud:CommCare Cloud Deployment Tool`,
   the command-line tool used to not only install CommCare HQ but also
   to manage a CommCare HQ instance through its entire life-cycle. This
   method gives you more visibility into installation process, more
   control and configuration options suitable to your own needs. This
   is the recommended way to setup a multi machine production grade
   CommCare HQ instance.
