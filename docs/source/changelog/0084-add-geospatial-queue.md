# 84. New Geospatial Celery Queue

**Date:** 2024-11-06

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
CommCare versions beyond the following commit require this change to function correctly:
[51370095](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/513700958cf443a85f0480ff681979d207f22db0)


## Change Context
The Microplanning feature requires the location properties on cases to be indexed correctly so
that they can be used correctly in this feature. A separate queue is added to handle this indexing
process when the Microplanning feature is enabled for a domain. This can potentially be a long-running
task, and so having a separate queue ensures that other queues do not get clogged up by this indexing task.

## Details
This creates a geospatial_queue in Celery, which will be used for indexing cases when enabling the
Microplanning feature.

## Steps to update
This update should be performed before updating CommCare to a version more recent than that specified above.

First, add a queue called `geospatial_queue` to your app_processes.yml,
following the examples in commcare-cloud commit [a94636b1d](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/commit/a94636b1d).

Then, to apply this change:

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs
```

Please note that a restart is required for the change to take effect and can be done as part of the above command
or with a separately done deploy.
