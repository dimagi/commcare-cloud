# 79. SQL Repeat Record Migration addendum

**Date:** 2024-02-13

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[58bc7541](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/58bc7541628b870216b2b072f7c89d01cb1cf225)


## Change Context
Optional: Copy repeat records with deleted repeaters from Couch to SQL

## Details
This is an optional procedure that should be done if you use data forwarding
and want to retain access to forwarding records that reference deleted
data forwarders. Otherwise this procedure may be skipped.

## Steps to update
Run the following commands:

```sh
# Create a private release in which to run management commands.
# Make a note of the release directory path.
cchq <env> deploy commcare --private --keep-days=30

# Start a screen session
cchq <env> ssh django_manage -t screen -S couch2sql

# If the connection drops, reconnect with
cchq <env> ssh django_manage -t screen -x couch2sql

# In the screen session
sudo -iu cchq
mkdir ~/couch2sql
cd <private-release-directory-path>  # created above

# Migrate deleted repeaters from Couch to SQL
./manage.py create_missing_repeaters

# Discard previous migration state
./manage.py populate_repeatrecords --log-path ~/couch2sql --override-is-migration-completed=discard

# Run the migration command
./manage.py populate_repeatrecords --log-path ~/couch2sql
# Re-run this command until it completes successfully (exit code 0).

# After successful completion, run again with --fixup-diffs=... if directed
# to do so by command output.
```

DO NOT delete repeat records from Couch DB yet, they are still needed! A
future change log entry will instruct when it is safe to do that.
