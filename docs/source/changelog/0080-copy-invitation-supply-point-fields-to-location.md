# 80. Copy Supply Point data to Invitation model Location Field

**Date:** 2024-04-30

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
CommCare versions beyond the following commit require this change to function correctly:
[72fc5f10](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/72fc5f10dd31c42d854d20ed99d435ff3d2ad7a0)
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[b2b03835](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/b2b0383598d89238466cfebc384b0c6e142961bc)


## Change Context
Copy data from `supply_point` field to `location` field in `Invitation` model to prevent errors with
future migrations to the `users_invitation` table.

This operation is required for all environments regardless of feature usage.

## Details
In the `Invitation` model, the `supply_point` field will be replaced by a foreign key reference
to `SQLLocation`. This migration is to prepare for that transition.

## Steps to update
Execute the following command:

```shell
$ commcare-cloud <env> django-manage --tmux copy_invitation_supply_point
```

Precautions:
* No downtime is needed for this operation however it is best to run the command during a period
  of low traffic.
