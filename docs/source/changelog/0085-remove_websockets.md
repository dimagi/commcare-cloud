# 85. Removing websockets

**Date:** 2025-03-21

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[c67e1a4d](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/c67e1a4d7e79eda106e51b7213d83de037493c9e)


## Change Context
All code related to websockets is being removed from both CommCare HQ and CommCare-Cloud.

## Details
This will also sunset the notifications that appear in the form builder for superusers only
that indicate another user is currently editing the same form. This feature is disabled in
the minimum CommCare HQ version referenced above.

Note that if the steps below are run **before** updating CommCare HQ to the minimum version above,
superusers using the form builder may experience warnings in the JavaScript console. However, there should
be no other ill effects.

A future update to CommCare HQ will remove additional websockets configuration code. This update will be
released **no sooner than Monday, April 14**. Once this update is released, if the steps below have **not**
been run, deploying CommCare HQ will fail until they are run.

## Steps to update
1. Run `update-code` to pull the latest code, specifically [https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/6481](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/6481)
2. Run `cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs`
