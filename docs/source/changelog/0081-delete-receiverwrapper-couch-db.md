# 81. SQL Repeat Record Migration - Delete Unused Couch Data

**Date:** 2024-06-18

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[4869285c](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/4869285c989542b464c8a0be1730fb10f2b36846)


## Change Context
Optional: Delete unused forwarding data from Couch.

## Details
This is an optional procedure that may be done if you use data forwarding and
want to free up space used by old forwarding data that has been migrated to
SQL. The procedure is optional because the data will automatically be removed
in the future, approximately 3 months from the release date of this change
log.

## Steps to update
Run the following commands:

```sh
cchq <env> django-manage --tmux delete_couch_dbs --dbname=receiverwrapper
```

Read and answer the prompts carefully. The command will show what will be
done, but will not actually delete the database. After it completes, in the
same tmux session run the following command and follow the prompts to delete
the database:

```sh
./manage.py delete_couch_dbs --dbname=receiverwrapper --commit
```

Exit the tmux session after the command completes.
