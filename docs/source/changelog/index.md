---
#### **2023-03-23** [Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04](0071-upgrade_to_ubuntu_22.04.md)
On April 1, 2023, the operating system that commcare-cloud has supported for the last 4-5 years,
Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic Beaver", will reach its end of life for support from its maintainer.

We are requiring that all CommCare HQ instances be upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish"
by July 1, 2023, in order to continue using commcare-cloud.
**Failure to update by this date will result in increasingly unexpected
behavior possibly including downtime and data loss.**

Schedule maintenance for a time well before July 1, 2023,
during which you should expect a downtime of up to many hours.
We also recommend making contingency plans
in case issues arise during the first attempt at applying this maintenance.
For example, you may want to set an early date in April, with backup dates in May and June
in case issues arise during the first attempt.


---
#### **2023-03-09** [Update Node to v16](0070-update-node-to-v16.md)

not done so already.


---
#### **2022-12-13** [remove-unused-elastic-settings](0066-remove-unused-elastic-settings.md)
CommCareHQ has two settings (`CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS` and
`ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`) that were created several years ago for tuning
Elasticsearch in a specific environment which no longer exists. This change
removes support for those settings and the application logic that existed for
them. We do not expect this to impact any self-hosted environments, but it's
prudent to confirm.


---
#### **2022-12-13** [Populate a new field for Data Forwarders](0065-Populate_repeater_names.md)
Populate a new field for all Data Forwarders (repeaters).

This is optional, but is recommended to do for all environments where Data Forwarders are being used. A migration
will be added in the future, which will automatically apply these changes during a code deploy if they have not
yet been applied. If there are many Data Forwarders, it will slow down the deploy process.

CommCareHQ has two elasticsearch indices "report_cases" and "report_xforms"
that were created many years ago for some custom reports, but which haven't
been used in some time. This change deletes those indices and the change
processors used to populate them. We do not expect this to impact any
self-hosted environments, but it's prudent to confirm.

#### **2021-03-23** [Optionally configure auditcare db](0043-optionally-configure-auditcare-db.md)
Some enterprise deployments of CommCare use a backend feature called
"auditcare" as part of their audit logging strategy. Auditcare is enabled by
default, so it is active unless you went out of your way to disable it when
you configured CommCare. Historically it has used CouchDB as its data
backend, but it is being switched to use PostgreSQL instead. If you care
about this feature then you may want to carefully consider this change log
before your next commcare deploy; otherwise you can ignore.


---
#### **2021-03-16** [Update Formplayer request mapping](0042-update_formplayer_request_mapping.md)
A small change to the nginx request matching for Formplayer requests that will prevent

Due to a [high-severity security advisory](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q) on the popular version control software program `git`,
observing security best practices dictates upgrading to one of the git versions designated as "Patched"
such as 2.26.1.


---
#### **2020-02-28** [Update `deploy` CommandArgs](0033-update-deploy-args.md)
We are adding support for deploying from a specific commit hash or tag, replacing
the deploy command's `commcare-branch` argument with a more general `commcare-rev` argument.

We are removing support for deploying Riak CS clusters in commcare-cloud


---
#### **2019-08-23** [Fix python3 virutalenvs (Deprecated)](0027-fix-python3-virtualenv.md)
**Update (2019-11-27)**: This fix is no longer necessary as it has been superceded by changes
to the deploy script that make this change automatically if necessary.

This fixes a bug with how python3 virtualenvs were created by ansible. This fix needs to be applied to any
machine which has a python3 virtualenv that was created by commcare-cloud.

The fix is also safe to run on all CommCare hosts.


---
#### **2019-08-21** [Move remaining management commands explicitly](0026-move-remaining-management-commands.md)
This change requires editing `app-processes.yml` to add some of processes to the `management_comamnds`

library which has been added as a requirement to commcare-hq for
proper pdf printing of unicode fonts


---
#### **2019-02-26** [Fix to restart nginx after every letsencrypt cert auto-renewal](0021-fix-letsencrypt-restart-nginx.md)
Previously you had to manually restart nginx every time letsencrypt auto-renewed,
which was about every two months. We believed we had fixed this with
[Restart nginx after every letsencrypt cert auto-renewal](0010-letsencrypt-restart-nginx),
but there was an error in our setup at that time that made it not work as intended.


---
#### **2019-04-05** [Update RabbitMQ logging configuration](0020-update-rabbitmq-logging.md)
This change updates the RabbitMQ logging configuration to change the
log level from `info` to `warning`.


---
#### **2019-02-27** [Remove celery results backend from localsettings](0019-remove-celery-results-backend-from-localsettings.md)
Upgrading to celery 4.x requires removing the dependency on
django-celery, which means that its results backend will no
longer be available.  This removes the django-celery backend
as the default from localsettings, so the results backend can
be specified by commcare-hq settings instead.


---
#### **2019-02-26** [Split pgbouncer vars from postgresql vars](0018-split_pgbouncer_postgresql_vars.md)
This change extracts a new role from the existing postgresql role for installing
and configuring pgbouncer.

As a result of this change the `postgresql.yml` environment configuration file
needs to be changed to split out the postgresql vars from the pgbouncer vars.


---
#### **2019-02-27** [Only monitor specific RabbitMQ queues](0017-monitor-specific-rabbitmq-queues.md)
Datadog RabbitMQ monitoring restricts the number of queues it
can monitor to 200. To avoid hitting this limit on large
scale deployments we limit the queues being monitored to only
the primary queues.


---
#### **2019-02-22** [Update supervisor confs to invoke celery directly](0016-invoke-celery-directly.md)
Upgrading to celery 4.x requires removing the dependency on
django-celery, which means that the celery management command
becomes unavailable.  This prepares for that by invoking the
celery command directly.


---
#### **2019-02-22** [Separate celery datadog http check](0015-separate-celery-datadog-http-check.md)
This adds a specific http check for the celery check (serverup.txt?only=celery)
to datadog.
Environments that are not relying on datadog for monitoring can ignore this change.


---
#### **2019-02-11** [Add tag to datadog http checks](0014-add-tag-to-datadog-http-checks.md)
This change adds "check_type" tag to the http_check datadog integration.

---
#### **2019-02-01** [Generalize load case from fixture feature](0012-generalize-load-case-from-fixture.md)
Previously loading a case from a fixture required the fixture to be an attribute.
This change allows using non-attributes from the fixture.


---
#### **2019-01-16** [Fix encrypted temp directory permissions](0011-fix-encrypted-tmp-permissions.md)
This is a followup to [Added encrypted temporary directory](./0001-add-encrypted-tmp.md)
in which we introduced an encrypted directory for temp files.
In its original implementation, this file was owned by root,
and processes were unable to write to it.

This changes the directory to be owned by cchq, allowing our processes to write to the file.


---
#### **2019-01-02** [Restart nginx after every letsencrypt cert auto-renewal](0010-letsencrypt-restart-nginx.md)
**Update 2019-02-26**: There was a bug in this fix and it has been superceded by
[Fix to restart nginx after every letsencrypt cert auto-renewal](0021-fix-letsencrypt-restart-nginx).

Previously you had to manually restart nginx every time letsencrypt auto-renewed,
which was about every two months.


---
#### **2018-12-15** [Blob Metadata Migration - part 2](0009-blob-metadata-part-2.md)
Form submission attachment metadata is being consolidated in the blob
metadata table in SQL. This migration consists of a series of commands that
will consolidate the data in your environment.


---
#### **2018-09-24** [Blob Metadata Migration - part 1](0008-blob-metadata-part-1.md)
Blob metadata needs to be migrated from CouchDB to SQL. This migration
consists of a series of commands that will move the data in your environment.


---
#### **2018-11-26** [Reorganize pillows](0007-reorganize-pillows.md)
Pillows read changes from kafka and do various processing such as sending them to
elasticsearch, transforming into a UCR table row etc. A doc for same change is read
multiple times for each processor, since there are separte pillows for each processor.
This is inefficient, so we have combined multiple processors that apply for a
given document type (also called `KAFKA_TOPIC`) such as form/case/user under
one pillow. For e.g. A new single `case-pillow` pillow replaces
various old pillows that process case changes such as `CaseToElasticsearchPillow`,
`CaseSearchToElasticsearchPillow`, `ReportCaseToElasticsearchPillow`,
and `kafka-ucr-main` etc. 


---
#### **2018-11-20** [New Case Importer Celery Queue](0006-new-case-importer-celery-queue.md)
Importing cases is often a time-sensitive task, and prolonged backlogs are
very visible to users.  It will be useful to have a separate queue
specifically for case imports, to improve visibility into backups as well as
typical runtimes.  Additionally, this is a first step towards allocating
resources specifically for case imports, should that become necessary.


---
#### **2018-08-16** [Support multiple Kafka brokers](0005-support-multiple-kafak-brokers.md)
Large scale deployments of CommCare require scaling out Kafka brokers to support the high
traffic volume (as well as for high availability). Up until now CommCare has only
supported a single broker.


---
#### **2018-08-16** [Add queue for analytics tasks](0004-add-analytics-queue.md)
Tasks for analytics reporting have been separated into a new analytics celery queue.


---
#### **2018-07-25** [Update Supervisor](0003-update-supervisor.md)
Ubuntu 14.04 `apt-get install supervisor` installs supervisor 3.0b.
We occasionally have issues that could be related to supervisor,
such as processes not stopping correctly.
To rule it out as a possible cause,
we decided it was better to be on a later version of supervisor,
and one that's not in beta.


---
#### **2018-07-13** [Update supervisor service definitions](0002-supervisor-service-definitions.md)
There are several CommCare specific processes that are defined in supervisor
configuration files. This change decouples the process definitions from code.


---
#### **2018-06-11** [Added encrypted temporary directory](0001-add-encrypted-tmp.md)
Some of the CommCare processes make use of temporary files to store client data
(such as data exports) so in order to keep that data protected we have modified
the setup to use an encrypted temporary directory.
