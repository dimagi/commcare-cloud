# 81. copy_web_user_permissions_to_tableau_config_permission

**Date:** 2024-05-16

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[00d7ec6e](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/00d7ec6e958f18c2813e33850e9b881cc621cc80)


## Change Context
Copies the edit/view permissions from 'Web User' to 'Manage Tableau Configuration' to maintain
the existing access rights for affected roles.

This operation is required for only requirements environments with domains that have [TABLEAU SYNC FF] (https://www.commcarehq.org/hq/flags/edit/tableau_user_syncing/) enabled

## Details
In this migration, we are introducing a new permission called 'Manage Tableau Configuration,'
which is a subset of the existing 'Web User' permission. The purpose of this migration is to
ensure that the behavior remains consistent for roles that currently have the 'Web User' permission.

## Steps to update
Execute the following command:

```sh
git checkout 00d7ec6e958f18c2813e33850e9b881cc621cc80
python manage.py migrate users 0065_transfer_to_tableau_config_permission
```

Precautions:
* No downtime is needed for this operation however it is best to run the command during a period
  of low traffic.
