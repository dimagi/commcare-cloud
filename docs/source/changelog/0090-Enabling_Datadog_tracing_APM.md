# 90. Enabling Datadog tracing (APM)

**Date:** 2025-10-08

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Configuration for enabling Datadog tracing with APM has changed. If you
use this feature you may need to update your configuration.

## Details
Previously variables `datadog_pythonagent`, `django_command_prefix`, and
`celery_command_prefix` could be used to enable Datadog APM on specific
processes. If you are using any of those options, you should update your
configuration to use the new `env_vars` sections of `app-processes.yml`
in your environment configuration.

## Steps to update
See usages of `env_vars` in
[app-processes.yml](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/blob/758df2f362d955d8b3740f32f0e7b14610f59b3a/environments/production/app-processes.yml)
for examples.

See https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/6700 for a technical
overview of what changed.
