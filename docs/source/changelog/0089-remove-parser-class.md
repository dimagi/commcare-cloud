# 89. Remove PARSER_CLASS from redis settings

**Date:** 2025-07-10

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
We've remove the PARSER_CLASS when configuring redis in settings.py.

## Details
The PARSER_CLASS setting when configuring redis is unnecessary and we've opted to remove it
to ensure future compatibility with the redis python client library.

The line being removed is:
  'PARSER_CLASS': 'redis.connection.HiredisParser'

While not recommended, if you have specified a different parser than HiredisParser, you will
be responsible for supporting it once commcare-hq upgrades the redis python library version in use.

## Steps to update
Just run `update-config`.
1. cchq <env> update-config
