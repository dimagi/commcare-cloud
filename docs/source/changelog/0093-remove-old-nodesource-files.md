# 93. Remove Old NodeSource Files

**Date:** 2026-01-01

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Remove no longer needed NodeSource files that break ``apt``.

## Details
After the most recent Node upgrade, we've encountered failures when running apt commands.
This is due to NodeSource apt files for previous version of Node no longer working correctly.
These files are no longer necessary and therefore can be safely removed.

## Steps to update
To remove old NodeSource files, run the following:
```bash
cchq <env> deploy-stack --tags=nodejs
```
