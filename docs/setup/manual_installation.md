# Manual Installation

## Install and setup
You will need python 2.7.12+ and `virtualenvwrapper` installed to follow these instructions:

```
sudo apt-get install git python-dev python-pip
sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper --ignore-installed six
```

## Setup

Download and run the `control/init.sh` script. This should be run from your home directory:

```
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/master/control/init.sh)
```

You may now use `commcare-cloud` or its shorter alias `cchq` whenever you're in the virtualenv.

We also recommend that you put the following in your `~/.profile` which gives you access to the tool
from anywhere:
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.commcare-cloud/bin
source ~/.commcare-cloud/repo/src/commcare_cloud/.bash_completion
```

## Manual setup

If you'd rather use your own virtualenv name, or the script above didn't work for you
the set up is pretty simple. Just run:

```
$ mkvirtualenv ansible
(ansible)$ git clone https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud.git
(ansible)$ pip install pip-tools
(ansible)$ pip-sync commcare-cloud/requirements.txt
(ansible)$ pip install -e commcare-cloud/
(ansible)$ manage-commcare-cloud install
(ansible)$ manage-commcare-cloud configure  # and copy the line from here into your ~/.bash_profile
```

You will then be able to use cchq from anywhere.
