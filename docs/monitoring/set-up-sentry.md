# Set up Sentry for error messages

## Register account on sentry.io

Go to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to create your account.

As of Dec 2018, there's a free tier that allows you to log up to 5k errors a month. 

Sentry allows you to divide your account into multiple "projects".
To log formplayer errors as well, we recommend creating a separate projects
called "commcarehq" and "formplayer". If you'd rather not, it should be possible
to send both errors to the same project.

## Configure for your account
Each account and project on Sentry will come with its own set of
IDs and keys, which you'll have to store in the environment configuration failes.
A complete configuration looks like this:

**public.yml**
```yaml
localsettings:
  SENTRY_ORGANIZATION_SLUG: 'organization slug'
  SENTRY_PROJECT_SLUG: 'commcare project slug'
  # Repository name for integrating commits into releases
  SENTRY_REPOSITORY: 'dimagi/commcare-hq'
```

**vault.yml**
```yaml
localsettings_private:
  SENTRY_DSN: 'https://{key}@sentry.io/{project_id}'
  # This token is used to create releases and deploys. It needs the 'project:releases' permission.
  SENTRY_API_KEY: '{token}'

  ...
secrets:
  FORMPLAYER_SENTRY_DSN: 'https://{key}@sentry.io/{project_id}' 
  ...
```

For more details see the [Sentry docs](https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/quickstart/?platform=python).
