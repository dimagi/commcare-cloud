Datadog for monitoring
======================

Datadog is a monitoring tool that has support for variety of
applications and is easily extendable which is why in our case it is
used for monitoring various system, application metrics and also custom
CommCareHQ metrics. You can read more about Datadog in their
`docs <https://docs.datadoghq.com>`_.

commcare-cloud can set up the requisite Datadog integration
automatically when you do a full stack deploy. You will need to set
``DATADOG_ENABLED`` to ``True`` in your environment's public.yml file
and add your account API keys to your vault file.

The default configuration sets up all Datadog integrations and there
might be a lot of data being generated in your Datadog account by your
CommCare instance. Individual integrations may be turned on/off by
setting relevant variables like ``datadog_integration_postgres`` or
``datadog_integration_redis`` etc. in your environment's public.yml
file.

After editing the vault file and the public.yml file, you will need to
update the config and restart services::

    $ commcare-cloud <env> update-config
    $ commcare-cloud <env> fab restart_services

There is more information about those files under
`Configuring your CommCare Cloud Environments Directory <../commcare-cloud/env/>`_


Recommended dashboards
======================

It is recommended to create relevant dashboards and monitoring alerts to
get insights into the health of your CommCare instance.

This is a minimal set of dashboards that we use internally that you can
import into your own account.

- `hq-vitals.json <datadog_dashboards/hq-vitals.json>`_ gives a glance
  of all components of CommCare
- `mobile-success.json <datadog_dashboards/mobile-success.json>`_ for
  monitoring success rate of mobile requests to the server
- `postgres-overview.json <datadog_dashboards/postgres-overview.json>`_
  for Postgres monitoring
- `celery.json <datadog_dashboards/celery.json>`_ for monitoring
  background application tasks of celery
- `couchdb.json <datadog_dashboards/couchdb.json>`_ for CouchDB
  monitoring

You may import them to your own account by running relevant Datadog API requests. For example, to import ``hq-vitals.json`` ::

    $ export api_key=<YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY>
    $ export application_key=<YOUR_DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY>
    $ curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -d @hq-vitals.json \
        "https://app.datadoghq.com/api/v1/dashboard?api_key=${api_key}&application_key=${application_key}"
