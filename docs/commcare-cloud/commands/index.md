## Running Commands with `commcare-cloud`

All `commcare-cloud` commands take the following form:

```
commcare-cloud [--control]
               <env>
               {bootstrap-users,ansible-playbook,django-manage,aps,tmux,ap,validate-environment-settings,restart-elasticsearch,deploy-stack,service,update-supervisor-confs,update-users,ping,migrate_couchdb,lookup,run-module,update-config,mosh,after-reboot,ssh,downtime,fab,update-local-known-hosts,migrate-couchdb,run-shell-command}
               ...
```

## Positional Arguments

### `<env>`

server environment to run against

## Optional Arguments

### `--control`

Run command remotely on the control machine.

You can add `--control` _directly after_ `commcare-cloud` to any command
in order to run the command not from the local machine
using the local code,
but from from the control machine for that environment,
using the latest version of `commcare-cloud` available.

It works by issuing a command to ssh into the control machine,
update the code, and run the same command entered locally but with
`--control` removed. For long-running commands,
you will have to remain connected to the the control machine
for the entirety of the run.


## `cchq` alias

Additionally, `commcare-cloud` is aliased to the easier-to-type `cchq`
(short for "CommCare HQ"), so any command you see here can also be run
as

```
cchq <env> <command> <args...>
```

## Underlying tools and common arguments

The `commcare-cloud` command line tool is by and large a relatively
thin wrapper around the other tools it uses: `ansible`, `ansible-playbook`,
`ssh`, `fab`, etc. For every command you run using `commcare-cloud`,
it will print out the underlying command that it is running,
a faint blue / cyan color.
In each case, if you copy and paste the printed command directly,
it will have essentially the same affect.
(Note too that some commands run
multiple underlying commands in sequence,
and that each command will be printed.)

Where possible, `commcare-cloud` is set up to pass any unknown arguments
to the underlying tool. In addition, there are a number of common
arguments that are recognized by many `commcare-cloud` commands,
and have similar behavior on across them. Rather than include these
on every command they apply to, we will list upfront
these common arguments and when they can be used.

To verify availability on any given command, you can always run the
command with `-h`.

### Ansible-backed commands

For most ansible-backed commands `commcare-cloud`
will run in check mode first, and then ask you to confirm
before applying the changes. Since check mode does not make sense
for all commands, there are some that do not follow this pattern
and apply the changes directly.

### `--skip-check`

When this argument is included,
the "check, ask, apply" behavior described above is circumvented,
and the command is instead applied directly

### `--quiet`

Run the command without every prompting for permission to continue.
At each point, the affirmative response is assumed.

### `--branch <branch>`

In the specific case that `commcare-cloud` has been installed from
git source in egg mode (i.e. using `pip install -e .`), it will always
check that the checked-out git branch matches the `<branch>`
that is thus passed in. If this arg is not specified,
it defaults to `master`. As a consequence, when running from git branch
`master`, there is no need to use the `--branch` arg explicitly.

### `--output [actionable|minimal]`

The callback plugin to use for generating output. See
ansible-doc -t callback -l and ansible-doc -t callback.

## Available Commands

### Internal Housekeeping for your `commcare-cloud` environments


#### `validate-environment-settings`

Validate your environment's configuration files

```
commcare-cloud <env> validate-environment-settings
```

As you make changes to your environment files, you can use this
command to check for validation errors or incompatibilities.


#### `update-local-known-hosts`

Update the local known_hosts file of the environment configuration.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-local-known-hosts [--use-factory-auth]
```

You can run this on a regular basis to avoid having to `yes` through
the ssh prompts. Note that when you run this, you are implicitly
trusting that at the moment you run it, there is no man-in-the-middle
attack going on, the type of security breech that the SSH prompt
is meant to mitigate against in the first place.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

### Ad-hoc


#### `lookup`

Lookup remote hostname or IP address

```
commcare-cloud <env> lookup [server]
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server name/group: postgresql, proxy, webworkers, ... The server
name/group may be prefixed with 'username@' to login as a
specific user and may be terminated with ':<n>' to choose one of
multiple servers if there is more than one in the group. For
example: webworkers:0 will pick the first webworker. May also be
omitted for environments with only a single server.


#### `ssh`

Connect to a remote host with ssh.

```
commcare-cloud <env> ssh [server]
```

This will also automatically add the ssh argument `-A`
when `<server>` is `control`.

All trailing arguments are passed directly to `ssh`.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server name/group: postgresql, proxy, webworkers, ... The server
name/group may be prefixed with 'username@' to login as a
specific user and may be terminated with ':<n>' to choose one of
multiple servers if there is more than one in the group. For
example: webworkers:0 will pick the first webworker. May also be
omitted for environments with only a single server.


#### `mosh`

Connect to a remote host with mosh.

```
commcare-cloud <env> mosh [server]
```

This will also automatically switch to using ssh with `-A`
when `<server>` is `control` (because `mosh` doesn't support `-A`).

All trailing arguments are passed directly to `mosh`
(or `ssh` in the edge case described above).

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server name/group: postgresql, proxy, webworkers, ... The server
name/group may be prefixed with 'username@' to login as a
specific user and may be terminated with ':<n>' to choose one of
multiple servers if there is more than one in the group. For
example: webworkers:0 will pick the first webworker. May also be
omitted for environments with only a single server.


#### `run-module`

Run an arbitrary Ansible module.

```
commcare-cloud <env> run-module [--use-factory-auth] inventory_group module module_args
```

#### Example

To print out the `inventory_hostname` ansible variable for each machine, run
```
commcare-cloud <env> run-module all debug "msg={{ '{{' }} inventory_hostname }}"
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `inventory_group`

Machines to run on. Is anything that could be used in as a value for
`hosts` in an playbook "play", e.g.
`all` for all machines,
`webworkers` for a single group,
`celery:pillowtop` for multiple groups, etc.
See the description in [this blog](http://goinbigdata.com/understanding-ansible-patterns/)
for more detail in what can go here.

###### `module`

The name of the ansible module to run. Complete list of built-in modules
can be found at [Module Index](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html).

###### `module_args`

Args for the module, formatted as a single string.

If this option is included, the management command will be
run in a new tmux window under the `cchq` user. You may then exit using
the customary tmux command `^b` `d`, and resume the session later.
This is especially useful for long-running commands.

###### `--release RELEASE`

Name of release to run under.
E.g. '2018-04-13_18.16'.
If none is specified, the `current` release will be used.

```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server to run tmux session on.
Use '-' to for default (webworkers:0)

###### `remote_command`

Command to run in the tmux.
If a command specified, then it will always run in a new window.
If a command is *not* specified, then a it will rejoin the most
recently visited tmux window; only if there are no currently open
tmux windows will a new one be opened.

### Operational

Run the ansible playbook for deploying the entire stack.

```
commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack [--use-factory-auth]
```

Often used in conjunction with --limit and/or --tag
for a more specific update.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `update-config`

Run the ansible playbook for updating app config.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-config [--use-factory-auth]
```

This includes django `localsettings.py` and formplayer `application.properties`.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `after-reboot`

Bring a just-rebooted machine back into operation.

```
commcare-cloud <env> after-reboot [--use-factory-auth] inventory_group
```

Includes mounting the encrypted drive.
This command never runs in check mode.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `inventory_group`

Machines to run on. Is anything that could be used in as a value for
`hosts` in an playbook "play", e.g.
`all` for all machines,
`webworkers` for a single group,
`celery:pillowtop` for multiple groups, etc.
See the description in [this blog](http://goinbigdata.com/understanding-ansible-patterns/)
for more detail in what can go here.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `restart-elasticsearch`

Do a rolling restart of elasticsearch.

```
commcare-cloud <env> restart-elasticsearch [--use-factory-auth]
```

**This command is deprecated.** Use

```
commcare-cloud <env> service elasticsearch restart
```

instead.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `bootstrap-users`

Add users to a set of new machines as root.

```
commcare-cloud <env> bootstrap-users [--use-factory-auth]
```

This must be done before any other user can log in.

This will set up machines to reject root login and require
password-less logins based on the usernames and public keys
you have specified in your environment. This can only be run once
per machine; if after running it you would like to run it again,
you have to use `update-users` below instead.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `update-users`

Bring users up to date with the current CommCare Cloud settings.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-users [--use-factory-auth]
```

In steady state this command (and not `bootstrap-users`) should be used
to keep machine user accounts, permissions, and login information
up to date.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `update-supervisor-confs`

Updates the supervisor configuration files for services required by CommCare.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs [--use-factory-auth]
```

These services are defined in app-processes.yml.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)


#### `fab`

Run a fab command as you would with fab

```
commcare-cloud <env> fab [-l] [fab_command]
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `fab_command`

The name of the fab task to run. It and all following arguments
will be passed on without modification to `fab`, so all normal `fab`
syntax rules apply.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `-l`

Use `-l` instead of a command to see the full list of commands.

#### `service`

Manage services.

```
commcare-cloud <env> service [--only PROCESS_PATTERN]
                             
                             {celery,commcare,couchdb,elasticsearch,formplayer,kafka,nginx,pillowtop,postgresql,rabbitmq,redis,riakcs,touchforms,webworker}
                             [{celery,commcare,couchdb,elasticsearch,formplayer,kafka,nginx,pillowtop,postgresql,rabbitmq,redis,riakcs,touchforms,webworker} ...]
                             {start,stop,restart,status,help}
```

#### Example

```
cchq <env> service postgresql status
cchq <env> service riakcs restart --only riak,riakcs
cchq <env> service celery help
cchq <env> service celery restart --limit <host>
cchq <env> service celery restart --only <queue-name>,<queue-name>:<queue_num>
cchq <env> service pillowtop restart --limit <host> --only <pillow-name>
```

Services are grouped together to form conceptual service groups.
Thus the `postgresql` service group applies to both the `postgresql`
service and the `pgbouncer` service. We'll call the actual services
"subservices" here.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `{celery,commcare,couchdb,elasticsearch,formplayer,kafka,nginx,pillowtop,postgresql,rabbitmq,redis,riakcs,touchforms,webworker}`

The name of the service group(s) to apply the action to.
There is a preset list of service groups that are supported.
More than one service may be supplied as separate arguments in a row.

###### `{start,stop,restart,status,help}`

Action can be `status`, `start`, `stop`, or `restart`.
This action is applied to every matching service.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--only PROCESS_PATTERN`

Sub-service name to limit action to.
Format as 'name' or 'name:number'.
Use 'help' action to list all options.


#### `migrate-couchdb`
(Alias `migrate_couchdb`)

Perform a CouchDB migration

```
commcare-cloud <env> migrate-couchdb migration_plan {describe,plan,migrate,commit}
```

This is a recent and advanced addition to the capabilities,
and is not yet ready for widespread use. At such a time as it is
ready, it will be more thoroughly documented.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `migration_plan`

Path to migration plan file

###### `{describe,plan,migrate,commit}`

Action to perform

- describe: Print out cluster info
- plan: generate plan details from migration plan
- migrate: stop nodes and copy shard data according to plan
- commit: update database docs with new shard allocation


#### `downtime`

Manage downtime for the selected environment.

```
commcare-cloud <env> downtime [-m MESSAGE] {start,end}
```

This notifies Datadog of the planned downtime so that is is recorded
in the history, and so that during it service alerts are silenced.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `{start,end}`

##### Optional Arguments

###### `-m MESSAGE, --message MESSAGE`

Optional message to set on Datadog.
