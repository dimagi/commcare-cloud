## Running Commands with `commcare-cloud`

All `commcare-cloud` commands take the following form:

```
commcare-cloud [--control]
               <env>
               {bootstrap-users,ansible-playbook,django-manage,aps,aws-sign-in,tmux,ap,validate-environment-settings,pillow-topic-assignments,openvpn-activate-user,deploy-stack,export-sentry-events,service,update-supervisor-confs,update-users,ping,migrate_couchdb,lookup,run-module,update-config,copy-files,couchdb-cluster-info,deploy,mosh,list-postgresql-dbs,after-reboot,ssh,downtime,fab,update-local-known-hosts,send-datadog-event,pillow-resource-report,aws-list,aws-fill-inventory,migrate-couchdb,terraform,openvpn-claim-user,celery-resource-report,run-shell-command,terraform-migrate-state}
               ...
```

## Positional Arguments

### `<env>`

server environment to run against

## Optional Arguments

### `--control`

Run command remotely on the control machine.

You can add `--control` _directly after_ `commcare-cloud` to any command
in order to run the command not from the local machine
using the local code,
but from from the control machine for that environment,
using the latest version of `commcare-cloud` available.

It works by issuing a command to ssh into the control machine,
update the code, and run the same command entered locally but with
`--control` removed. For long-running commands,
you will have to remain connected to the the control machine
for the entirety of the run.


## `cchq` alias

Additionally, `commcare-cloud` is aliased to the easier-to-type `cchq`
(short for "CommCare HQ"), so any command you see here can also be run
as

```
cchq <env> <command> <args...>
```

## Underlying tools and common arguments

The `commcare-cloud` command line tool is by and large a relatively
thin wrapper around the other tools it uses: `ansible`, `ansible-playbook`,
`ssh`, `fab`, etc. For every command you run using `commcare-cloud`,
it will print out the underlying command that it is running,
a faint blue / cyan color.
In each case, if you copy and paste the printed command directly,
it will have essentially the same affect.
(Note too that some commands run
multiple underlying commands in sequence,
and that each command will be printed.)

Where possible, `commcare-cloud` is set up to pass any unknown arguments
to the underlying tool. In addition, there are a number of common
arguments that are recognized by many `commcare-cloud` commands,
and have similar behavior on across them. Rather than include these
on every command they apply to, we will list upfront
these common arguments and when they can be used.

To verify availability on any given command, you can always run the
command with `-h`.

### Ansible-backed commands

For most ansible-backed commands `commcare-cloud`
will run in check mode first, and then ask you to confirm
before applying the changes. Since check mode does not make sense
for all commands, there are some that do not follow this pattern
and apply the changes directly.

### `--skip-check`

When this argument is included,
the "check, ask, apply" behavior described above is circumvented,
and the command is instead applied directly

### `--quiet`

Run the command without every prompting for permission to continue.
At each point, the affirmative response is assumed.

### `--branch <branch>`

In the specific case that `commcare-cloud` has been installed from
git source in egg mode (i.e. using `pip install -e .`), it will always
check that the checked-out git branch matches the `<branch>`
that is thus passed in. If this arg is not specified,
it defaults to `master`. As a consequence, when running from git branch
`master`, there is no need to use the `--branch` arg explicitly.

### `--output [actionable|minimal]`

The callback plugin to use for generating output. See
ansible-doc -t callback -l and ansible-doc -t callback.

## Available Commands

### Internal Housekeeping for your `commcare-cloud` environments

---
#### `validate-environment-settings`

Validate your environment's configuration files

```
commcare-cloud <env> validate-environment-settings
```

As you make changes to your environment files, you can use this
command to check for validation errors or incompatibilities.

---

#### `update-local-known-hosts`

Update the local known_hosts file of the environment configuration.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-local-known-hosts
```

You can run this on a regular basis to avoid having to `yes` through
the ssh prompts. Note that when you run this, you are implicitly
trusting that at the moment you run it, there is no man-in-the-middle
attack going on, the type of security breech that the SSH prompt
is meant to mitigate against in the first place.

---
### Ad-hoc

---
#### `lookup`

Lookup remote hostname or IP address

```
commcare-cloud <env> lookup [server]
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server name/group: postgresql, proxy, webworkers, ... The server
name/group may be prefixed with 'username@' to login as a
specific user and may be terminated with ':<n>' to choose one of
multiple servers if there is more than one in the group. For
example: webworkers:0 will pick the first webworker. May also be
omitted for environments with only a single server.

---

#### `ssh`

Connect to a remote host with ssh.

```
commcare-cloud <env> ssh [server]
```

This will also automatically add the ssh argument `-A`
when `<server>` is `control`.

All trailing arguments are passed directly to `ssh`.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server name/group: postgresql, proxy, webworkers, ... The server
name/group may be prefixed with 'username@' to login as a
specific user and may be terminated with ':<n>' to choose one of
multiple servers if there is more than one in the group. For
example: webworkers:0 will pick the first webworker. May also be
omitted for environments with only a single server.

---

#### `mosh`

Connect to a remote host with mosh.

```
commcare-cloud <env> mosh [server]
```

This will also automatically switch to using ssh with `-A`
when `<server>` is `control` (because `mosh` doesn't support `-A`).

All trailing arguments are passed directly to `mosh`
(or `ssh` in the edge case described above).

##### Positional Arguments

###### `server`

Server name/group: postgresql, proxy, webworkers, ... The server
name/group may be prefixed with 'username@' to login as a
specific user and may be terminated with ':<n>' to choose one of
multiple servers if there is more than one in the group. For
example: webworkers:0 will pick the first webworker. May also be
omitted for environments with only a single server.

---

#### `run-module`

Run an arbitrary Ansible module.

```
commcare-cloud <env> run-module [--use-factory-auth] inventory_group module module_args
```

##### Example

To print out the `inventory_hostname` ansible variable for each machine, run
```
commcare-cloud <env> run-module all debug "msg={{ '{{' }} inventory_hostname }}"
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `inventory_group`

Machines to run on. Is anything that could be used in as a value for
`hosts` in an playbook "play", e.g.
`all` for all machines,
`webworkers` for a single group,
`celery:pillowtop` for multiple groups, etc.
See the description in [this blog](http://goinbigdata.com/understanding-ansible-patterns/)
for more detail in what can go here.

###### `module`

The name of the ansible module to run. Complete list of built-in modules
can be found at [Module Index](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html).

###### `module_args`

Args for the module, formatted as a single string.
(Tip: put quotes around it, as it will likely contain spaces.)

```

---

#### `deploy-stack`
(Alias `aps`)

Run the ansible playbook for deploying the entire stack.

```
commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack [--use-factory-auth] [--first-time]
```

Often used in conjunction with --limit and/or --tag
for a more specific update.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

###### `--first-time`

Use this flag for running against a newly-created machine.

It will first use factory auth to set up users,
and then will do the rest of deploy-stack normally,
but skipping check mode.

Running with this flag is equivalent to

```
commcare-cloud <env> bootstrap-users <...args>
commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --skip-check --skip-tags=users <...args>
```

If you run and it fails half way, when you're ready to retry, you're probably
better off running
```
commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --skip-check --skip-tags=users <...args>
```
since if it made it through bootstrap-users
you won't be able to run bootstrap-users again.

---

#### `update-config`

Run the ansible playbook for updating app config.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-config
```

This includes django `localsettings.py` and formplayer `application.properties`.

---

#### `after-reboot`

Bring a just-rebooted machine back into operation.

```
commcare-cloud <env> after-reboot [--use-factory-auth] inventory_group
```

Includes mounting the encrypted drive.
This command never runs in check mode.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `inventory_group`

Machines to run on. Is anything that could be used in as a value for
`hosts` in an playbook "play", e.g.
`all` for all machines,
`webworkers` for a single group,
`celery:pillowtop` for multiple groups, etc.
See the description in [this blog](http://goinbigdata.com/understanding-ansible-patterns/)
for more detail in what can go here.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

---

#### `bootstrap-users`

Add users to a set of new machines as root.

```
commcare-cloud <env> bootstrap-users [--use-factory-auth]
```

This must be done before any other user can log in.

This will set up machines to reject root login and require
password-less logins based on the usernames and public keys
you have specified in your environment. This can only be run once
per machine; if after running it you would like to run it again,
you have to use `update-users` below instead.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

---

#### `update-users`

Bring users up to date with the current CommCare Cloud settings.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-users [--use-factory-auth]
```

In steady state this command (and not `bootstrap-users`) should be used
to keep machine user accounts, permissions, and login information
up to date.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

---

#### `update-supervisor-confs`

Updates the supervisor configuration files for services required by CommCare.

```
commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs [--use-factory-auth]
```

These services are defined in app-processes.yml.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

---

#### `fab`

Run a fab command as you would with fab

```
commcare-cloud <env> fab [-l] [fab_command]
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `fab_command`

The name of the fab task to run. It and all following arguments
will be passed on without modification to `fab`, so all normal `fab`
syntax rules apply.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `-l`

Use `-l` instead of a command to see the full list of commands.

#### `deploy`

Deploy CommCare

```
commcare-cloud <env> deploy [--resume] [--skip-record] [--commcare-branch COMMCARE_BRANCH] [{commcare,formplayer}]
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `{commcare,formplayer}`

The component to deploy.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--resume`

Rather than starting a new deploy, start where you left off the last one.

###### `--skip-record`

Skip the steps involved in recording and announcing the fact of the deploy.

###### `--commcare-branch COMMCARE_BRANCH`

The name of the commcare-hq git branch to deploy.

---

#### `service`

Manage services.

```
commcare-cloud <env> service [--only PROCESS_PATTERN]
                             
                             {celery,citusdb,commcare,couchdb2,elasticsearch,elasticsearch-classic,formplayer,kafka,nginx,pillowtop,postgresql,rabbitmq,redis,webworker}
                             [{celery,citusdb,commcare,couchdb2,elasticsearch,elasticsearch-classic,formplayer,kafka,nginx,pillowtop,postgresql,rabbitmq,redis,webworker} ...]
                             {start,stop,restart,status,logs,help}
```

##### Example

```
cchq <env> service postgresql status
cchq <env> service celery help
cchq <env> service celery logs
cchq <env> service celery restart --limit <host>
cchq <env> service celery restart --only <queue-name>,<queue-name>:<queue_num>
cchq <env> service pillowtop restart --limit <host> --only <pillow-name>
```

Services are grouped together to form conceptual service groups.
Thus the `postgresql` service group applies to both the `postgresql`
service and the `pgbouncer` service. We'll call the actual services
"subservices" here.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `{celery,citusdb,commcare,couchdb2,elasticsearch,elasticsearch-classic,formplayer,kafka,nginx,pillowtop,postgresql,rabbitmq,redis,webworker}`

The name of the service group(s) to apply the action to.
There is a preset list of service groups that are supported.
More than one service may be supplied as separate arguments in a row.

###### `{start,stop,restart,status,logs,help}`

Action can be `status`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, or `logs`.
This action is applied to every matching service.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--only PROCESS_PATTERN`

Sub-service name to limit action to.
Format as 'name' or 'name:number'.
Use 'help' action to list all options.

---

#### `migrate-couchdb`
(Alias `migrate_couchdb`)

Perform a CouchDB migration

```
commcare-cloud <env> migrate-couchdb [--no-stop] migration_plan {describe,plan,migrate,commit,clean}
```

This is a recent and advanced addition to the capabilities,
and is not yet ready for widespread use. At such a time as it is
ready, it will be more thoroughly documented.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `migration_plan`

Path to migration plan file

###### `{describe,plan,migrate,commit,clean}`

Action to perform

- describe: Print out cluster info
- plan: generate plan details from migration plan
- migrate: stop nodes and copy shard data according to plan
- commit: update database docs with new shard allocation
- clean: remove shard files from hosts where they aren't needed

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--no-stop`

When used with migrate, operate on live couchdb cluster without stopping nodes.

This is potentially dangerous.
If the sets of a shard's old locations and new locations are disjoint---i.e.
if there are no "pivot" locations for a shard---then running migrate and commit
without stopping couchdb will result in data loss.
If your shard reallocation has a pivot location for each shard,
then it's acceptable to do live.

---

#### `downtime`

Manage downtime for the selected environment.

```
commcare-cloud <env> downtime [-m MESSAGE] [-d DURATION] {start,end}
```

This notifies Datadog of the planned downtime so that is is recorded
in the history, and so that during it service alerts are silenced.

##### Positional Arguments

###### `{start,end}`

##### Optional Arguments

###### `-m MESSAGE, --message MESSAGE`

Optional message to set on Datadog.

###### `-d DURATION, --duration DURATION`

Max duration in hours for the Datadog downtime after which it will be auto-cancelled.
This is a safeguard against downtime remaining active and preventing future
alerts.
Default: 24 hours

---

#### `copy-files`

Copy files from multiple sources to targets.

```
commcare-cloud <env> copy-files plan_path {prepare,copy,cleanup}
```

This is a general purpose command that can be used to copy files between
hosts in the cluster.

Files are copied using `rsync` from the target host. This tool assumes that the
specified user on the source host has permissions to read the files being copied.

The plan file must be formatted as follows:

```yml
source_env: env1 (optional if source is different from target)
copy_files:
  - <target-host>:
      - source_host: <source-host>
        source_user: <user>
        source_dir: <source-dir>
        target_dir: <target-dir>
        rsync_args: []
        files:
          - test/
          - test1/test-file.txt
        exclude:
          - logs/*
          - test/temp.txt
```       
- **copy_files**: Multiple target hosts can be listed. 
- **target-host**: Hostname or IP of the target host. Multiple source definitions can be 
listed for each target host.
- **source-host**: Hostname or IP of the source host.
- **source-user**: (optional) User to ssh as from target to source. Defaults to 'ansible'. This user must have permissions
to read the files being copied.
- **source-dir**: The base directory from which all source files referenced.
- **target-dir**: Directory on the target host to copy the files to.
- **rsync_args**: Additional arguments to pass to rsync.
- **files**: List of files to copy. File paths are relative to `source-dir`. Directories can be included and must
end with a `/`.
- **exclude**: (optional) List of relative paths to exclude from the *source-dir*. Supports wildcards e.g. "logs/*".

##### Positional Arguments

###### `plan_path`

Path to plan file

###### `{prepare,copy,cleanup}`

Action to perform

- prepare: generate the scripts and push them to the target servers
- migrate: execute the scripts
- cleanup: remove temporary files and remote auth

---

#### `list-postgresql-dbs`

Example:

```
commcare-cloud <env> list-postgresql-dbs [--compare]
```

To list all database on a particular environment.

```
commcare-cloud <ev> list-databases
```

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--compare`

Gives additional databases on the server.

---

#### `celery-resource-report`

Report of celery resources by queue.

```
commcare-cloud <env> celery-resource-report [--show-workers] [--csv]
```

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--show-workers`

Includes the list of worker nodes for each queue

###### `--csv`

Output table as CSV

---

#### `pillow-resource-report`

Report of pillow resources.

```
commcare-cloud <env> pillow-resource-report [--csv]
```

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--csv`

Output table as CSV

---

#### `couchdb-cluster-info`

Output information about the CouchDB cluster

```
commcare-cloud <env> couchdb-cluster-info
```

---

#### `terraform`

Run terraform for this env with the given arguments

```
commcare-cloud <env> terraform [--skip-secrets] [--apply-immediately] [--username USERNAME]
```

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--skip-secrets`

Skip regenerating the secrets file.

Good for not having to enter vault password again.

###### `--apply-immediately`

Apply immediately regardless fo the default.

In RDS where the default is to apply in the next maintenance window,
use this to apply immediately instead. This may result in a service interruption.

###### `--username USERNAME`

The username of the user whose public key will be put on new servers.

Normally this would be _your_ username.
Defaults to the value of the COMMCARE_CLOUD_DEFAULT_USERNAME environment variable
or else the username of the user running the command.

---

#### `terraform-migrate-state`

Apply unapplied state migrations in commcare_cloud/commands/terraform/migrations

```
commcare-cloud <env> terraform-migrate-state
```

This migration tool should exist as a generic tool for terraform,
but terraform is still not that mature, and it doesn't seem to exist yet.

Terraform assigns each resource an address so that it can map it back to the code.
However, often when you change the code, the addresses no longer map to the same place.
For this, terraform offers the terraform state mv &lt;address&gt; &lt;new_address&gt; command,
so you can tell it how existing resources map to your new code.

This is a tedious task, and often follows a very predictable renaming pattern.
This command helps fill this gap.

---

#### `aws-sign-in`

Use your MFA device to "sign in" to AWS for &lt;duration&gt; minutes (default 30)

```
commcare-cloud <env> aws-sign-in [--duration-minutes DURATION_MINUTES]
```

This will store the temporary session credentials in ~/.aws/credentials
under a profile named with the pattern "&lt;aws_profile&gt;:profile".
After this you can use other AWS-related commands for up to &lt;duration&gt; minutes
before having to sign in again.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--duration-minutes DURATION_MINUTES`

Stay signed in for this many minutes

---

#### `aws-list`

List endpoints (ec2, rds, etc.) on AWS

```
commcare-cloud <env> aws-list
```

---

#### `aws-fill-inventory`

Fill inventory.ini.j2 using AWS resource values cached in aws-resources.yml

```
commcare-cloud <env> aws-fill-inventory [--cached]
```

If --cached is not specified, also refresh aws-resources.yml
to match what is actually in AWS.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--cached`

Use the values set in aws-resources.yml rather than fetching from AWS.

This runs much more quickly and gives the same result, provided no changes
have been made to our actual resources in AWS.

---

#### `openvpn-activate-user`

Give a OpenVPN user a temporary password (the ansible user password)

```
commcare-cloud <env> openvpn-activate-user [--use-factory-auth] vpn_user
```

to allow the user to connect to the VPN, log in, and change their password using

```
cchq <env> openvpn-claim-user
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `vpn_user`

The user to activate.

Must be one of the defined ssh users defined for the environment.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)

---

#### `openvpn-claim-user`

Claim an OpenVPN user as your own, setting its password

```
commcare-cloud <env> openvpn-claim-user [--use-factory-auth] vpn_user
```

##### Positional Arguments

###### `vpn_user`

The user to claim.

Must be one of the defined ssh users defined for the environment.

##### Optional Arguments

###### `--use-factory-auth`

authenticate using the pem file (or prompt for root password if there is no pem file)
