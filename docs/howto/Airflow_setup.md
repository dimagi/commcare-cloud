## Migrating Airflow
1. Add the node information in inventory with `airflow` group assigned to it. (leave old host in `airflow_scheduler` group)
2. Run `deploy-stack` command. It will replicate all the jobs in the new node.
4. At this point we have two nodes with replicated job on both nodes. Before proceeding stop the scheduler  with `supervisorctl` on old  node.
5. Replace host in airflow_scheduler group with the new host.
6. Run `deploy-stack` again (or just `update-supervisor-confs`) to create the configs for the scheduler on the new host.
7. Make sure you can access the `WEB UI` and it has all the task to the new machines.
8. Remove the old node from inventory.
