## Style Guide

This documentation contained is intended to be exhaustive, covering information relevant to every step in the life-cycle of hosting a CommCare instance such as info on planning a CommCare HQ installation, installing, managing an instance, scaling, troubleshooting and various reference material. Before creating a new document or editing an existing one, please familiarize yourself with the below principles that the docs must adhere to.

### Principles


1. **State the purpose of the page**: Think of the purpose of the page you are editing and write a short overview/intro stating that at the beginning of that page.
2. **Keep a consistent structure**: Each page should have an intro/overview, subsections if the page is long, content of the each section and where applicable a pointer to next potential page the reader might be interested. Page level table of contents is not necessary because if the headings are correctly used they automatically get added to the fixed table of contents section on the left side of all pages.
3. **Format for scanning**: The readers of these docs might refer to pages to just find a command or possible values to a configuration option to solve an issue at hand. So format the text in a way for the reader to easily scan the page by using code highlighters as appropriate.
4. **Place the page in most relevant location**: The docs have a clear separate sections for each phase of the hosting life-cycle. Think of the the context in which the reader will read the page, whether it's while installing, monitoring or troubleshooting an issue. Accordingly, place that page in the most relevant location so that the docs follow a logical order. Also add a link to the page in the top level index.rst for the respective section. This improves the discoverability of the content.
5. **Don't mix content types**: A page could be a step by step tutorial or an explanation or a reference. Unless necessary, avoid mixing the content types. For example, if a tutorial should let the user know the options for a command, link to a page in the reference sections instead of putting the reference material in the tutorial. This might be exempt if the reference is only relevant in the tutorial.
6. **Use consistent language**: Refer to the below [terminology](#terminology) section and use terms consistently.
7. **Keep in mind the audience**: The readers for these docs could be an external IT team hosting CommCare HQ locally or a Dimagi engineer or a third-party Dimagi contractor. Do not assume any roles such as a system administrator or an HQ/mobile dev or an MSP etc.
8. **Use relative links**: For referring to internal pages refer to them via relative links rather than links based on the host https://commcare-cloud.readthedocs.io/ which could change.
