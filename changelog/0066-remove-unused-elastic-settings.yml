context: |
  CommCareHQ has two settings (`CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS` and
  `ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`) that were created several years ago for tuning
  Elasticsearch in a specific environment which no longer exists. This change
  removes support for those settings and the application logic that existed for
  them. We do not expect this to impact any self-hosted environments, but it's
  prudent to confirm.

details: |
  If your environment references either of the following Django settings then
  they will need to be removed:

  - `CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS`
  - `ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`

update_steps: |
  Search your environment's public.yml `localsettings` section for
  `CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS` and `ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`. If present, they may
  look something like this:

  ```yaml
  localsettings:
    # ...
    CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS: True
    ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL: True
  ```

  If either of these values are present, remove them.
