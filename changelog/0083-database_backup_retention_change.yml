context: |
  The logic used to retain database backups has been modified to better respect the settings that specify
  how many days to keep backups.

details: |
  No action is needed. This is just to inform you that the logic determining which backups to
  keep has been modified. This impacts the values set for services like [couchdb](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/blob/c3abda48758fb337ca87e8039f1b97e333129351/src/commcare_cloud/ansible/roles/couchdb2/defaults/main.yml#L9-L10),
  [postgres](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/blob/c3abda48758fb337ca87e8039f1b97e333129351/src/commcare_cloud/ansible/roles/pg_backup/defaults/main.yml#L9-L10),
  and [blob](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/blob/c3abda48758fb337ca87e8039f1b97e333129351/src/commcare_cloud/ansible/roles/backups/defaults/main.yml#L5-L6).

  Put simply, if the <service>_backup_days value was set to 2, 4 daily backups would exist on your
  machine at any given time. This change reduces that value to 3 which is more in line with what
  it means to keep backups for 2 days.
