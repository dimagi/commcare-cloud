title: Java upgrade for formplayer
key: java-upgrade-for-formplayer
date: 2019-02-11
optional_per_env: no

context: |
  Previously, Formplayer was running on Java 7.
  This change updates us to Java 8 for formplayer.

details: |
  This only affects the machine that formplayer is on.
  If formplayer is installed on a machine with other Java processes,
  all Java processes on that machine will now be using Java 8 as well.
  We expect this to work without issue either way.

update_steps: |

  1. Install the java 8 on formplayer server

      ```
      commcare-cloud <env> ap deploy_formplayer.yml --limit=formplayer
      ```

  2. Restart the all java processess on formplayer server to take the latest java changes.
      To see a full list of processes using java, run.

      ```
      ps -ef | grep java
      ```
      Then for each one, use `service ... restart` to restart the process.
