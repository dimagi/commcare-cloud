optional_per_env: no

max_commcare_version: e25dbd4aa88523e3913f0acfae7c98e32f4c06c1

context: |
  Previously loading a case from a fixture required the fixture to be an attribute.
  This change allows using non-attributes from the fixture.

details: |
  This migration will require running a management command after deploying.

update_steps: |
  After deploying run `./manage.py migrate_load_case_from_fixture.py`. This will
  iterate over all applications and builds and update their definitions to the
  more generalized form.

  Note: if you receive a 413 request entity too large error, you may need to 
  increase your environment's
  [couchdb2_client_max_body_size](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/blob/11312a3083a9535bd433b72cd46c1f021eedd4be/src/commcare_cloud/ansible/group_vars/couchdb2_proxy.yml#L6)
