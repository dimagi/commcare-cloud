title: Update supervisor confs to invoke celery directly
key: invoke-celery-directly

optional_per_env: no
min_commcare_version: 08e5a3c1f7482ea30f071044431e42fe1c6e2f04
max_commcare_version: 0ffef2b55910f9476d9aa4c9cc5c7d47b4f4e390
context: |
  Upgrading to celery 4.x requires removing the dependency on
  django-celery, which means that the celery management command
  becomes unavailable.  This prepares for that by invoking the
  celery command directly.

details: |
  If the supervisor conf changes here are deployed prior to the
  minimum CommCare version, then celery will be unable to start
  because the file corehq/celery.py is missing.

  If celery is upgraded to 4.x prior to applying these changes,
  celery also will be unable to start since starting celery via
  the django_celery management command is no longer possible in
  celery 4.x.

update_steps: |
  Update supervisor confs:
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs
  ```
