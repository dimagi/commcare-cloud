context: |
  The Microplanning feature requires the location properties on cases to be indexed correctly so
  that they can be used correctly in this feature. A separate queue is added to handle this indexing
  process when the Microplanning feature is enabled for a domain. This can potentially be a long-running
  task, and so having a separate queue ensures that other queues do not get clogged up by this indexing task.

details: |
  This creates a geospatial_queue in Celery, which will be used for indexing cases when enabling the
  Microplanning feature.

update_steps: |
  This update should be performed before updating CommCare to a version more recent than that specified above.

  First, add a queue called `geospatial_queue` to your app_processes.yml,
  following the examples in commcare-cloud commit [a94636b1d](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/commit/a94636b1d).

  Then, to apply this change:

  ```
  commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs
  ```

  Please note that a restart is required for the change to take effect and can be done as part of the above command
  or with a separately done deploy.
