  It is stronly recommended to sanitize legacy Django sessions after upgrading
  to Django 2.2.

details: |
  CommCareHQ has recently been upgraded to use Django 2.2. The change includes a
  library upgrade that patches CVE-2020-15105. See the
  [security advisory](https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-vhr6-pvjm-9qwf)
  for complete details.

update_steps: |
  Run the following management command to sanitize sessions containing sensitive
  information:

  ```bash
  cchq <env> django-manage clean_2fa_sessions
  ```

  The impact on users is minimal. It is possible but very unlikely that a user
  who is about to enter their 2FA code will be re-prompted for username and
  password after the command is run, but other than that it should have no
  impact on active sessions.
