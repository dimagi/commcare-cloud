  Ubuntu 14.04 `apt-get install supervisor` installs supervisor 3.0b.
  We occasionally have issues that could be related to supervisor,
  such as processes not stopping correctly.
  To rule it out as a possible cause,
  we decided it was better to be on a later version of supervisor,
  and one that's not in beta.
