  The Sentry SDK used by CommCare HQ has been updated and along with it we have updated the
  configuration parameters.

details: |
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
  libraries we have updated the Sentry integration to use the new Sentry SDK. During that
  process we have re-structred how the configuration is set and have also fixed a few
  places that were not configurable such as Organization and Project.

update_steps: |
  Update `vault.yml`:

  ```diff
    localsettings_private:
  -   SENTRY_PUBLIC_KEY: 'xxx'
  -   SENTRY_PRIVATE_KEY: 'xxx'
  -   SENTRY_PROJECT_ID: 'xxx'
  -   SENTRY_QUERY_URL: 'https://...'
  +   SENTRY_DSN: 'dsn from Sentry'
  ```

  Update `public.yml`:

  ```diff
    localsettings:
  +   SENTRY_ORGANIZATION_SLUG: 'org slug'
  +   SENTRY_PROJECT_SLUG: 'project slug'
  +   SENTRY_REPOSITORY: 'repository name'
  ```
