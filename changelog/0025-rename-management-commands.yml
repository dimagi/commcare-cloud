context: |
  This change requires editing `app-processes.yml` to rename some of the processes in the `management_comamnds`
  section

details: |
  To simplify the mapping of management commands to process names we have renamed two of the commands to match
  the actual Django management command names:

  * sms_queue -> run_sms_queue
  * submission_reprocessing_queue -> run_submission_reprocessing_queue

update_steps: |
  1. Change any references to the old management command names to the new name in `app-processes.yml`
  2. Run `cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs`
