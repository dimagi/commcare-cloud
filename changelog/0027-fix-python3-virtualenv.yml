  **Update (2019-11-27)**: This fix is no longer necessary as it has been superceded by changes
  to the deploy script that make this change automatically if necessary.

  This fixes a bug with how python3 virtualenvs were created by ansible. This fix needs to be applied to any
  machine which has a python3 virtualenv that was created by commcare-cloud.

  The fix is also safe to run on all CommCare hosts.

details: |
  The python3 virutalenv contains a path to the 'current' folder instead of the release folder. This
  can cause problems when updating python libraries.

update_steps: |
  1. Run the following command, replacing `<env>` for the name of your environment:

  ```
  $ commcare-cloud <env> run-shell-command webworkers:pillowtop:celery:airflow:proxy:formplayer:django_manage 'sed -i -e "s~/home/cchq/www/{{ deploy_env }}/current~$(readlink -f /home/cchq/www/{{ deploy_env }}/current/)~g" /home/cchq/www/{{ deploy_env }}/current/python_env-3.6/bin/activate' -e deploy_env=<env> -b --become-user cchq

  ```
