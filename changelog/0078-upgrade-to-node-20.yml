  Node.js 16.x LTS is reaching its end of life 15th June 2024, so node and npm must be upgraded on all machines.

details: |
  Because the current LTS version we are using of Node.js (16.x) is reaching its end of life on the 30th of April,
  we are upgrading Node.js to the current LTS version 20.11. As npm is tightly-coupled with node, we are also upgrading npm to 10.2.x.

update_steps: |
  To upgrade node.js and npm on your machines please run:
  ```bash
  cchq <env> deploy-stack --tags=npm
  ```
