  Importing cases is often a time-sensitive task, and prolonged backlogs are
  very visible to users.  It will be useful to have a separate queue
  specifically for case imports, to improve visibility into backups as well as
  typical runtimes.  Additionally, this is a first step towards allocating
  resources specifically for case imports, should that become necessary.
