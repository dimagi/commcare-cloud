context: |
  Pillows read changes from kafka and do various processing such as sending  to
  elasticsearch, transforming into a UCR table row etc. A doc for same change is read
  multiple times for each processor, since there are pillows for each processor.
  This is inefficient, so we have combined multiple processors that apply for a
  given document type (also called `KAFKA_TOPIC`) such as form/case/user under
  one pillow. For e.g. A new single `get_ucr_es_case_pillow` pillow replaces
  various old pillows that process case changes such as `CaseToElasticsearchPillow`,
  `CaseSearchToElasticsearchPillow`, `ReportCaseToElasticsearchPillow`,
  and `kafka-ucr-main` etc. 


details: |
  This change replaces old pillows with new pillows. New pillows start
  processing at the oldest change of all of old pillows to ensure all changes
  are processed by all processors. So initially some changes may be reprocessed for some 
  processors, so it will be prudent to make sure that there is
  no large difference in checkpoints between the pillows to be reorganized.
  This can be checked by dry running step 3 of update steps below at anytime.

  Exact reorganization is as per below.

  Old Pillow | New Pillow
  -- | --
  CaseToElasticsearchPillow | get_ucr_es_case_pillow
  CaseSearchToElasticsearchPillow | get_ucr_es_case_pillow
  kafka-ucr-static | get_ucr_es_case_pillow, get_ucr_es_form_pillow, get_user_es_ucr_pillow
  XFormToElasticsearchPillow | get_ucr_es_form_pillow
  FormSubmissionMetadataTrackerPillow | get_ucr_es_form_pillow

update_steps: |
  Ensure that you have deployed a version of CommCare later than the version mentioned above
  and that none of pillows for a given document type are too far behind from each other.

  1. Replace old pillows with new pillows in pillow section of your app_processes.yml
     Here's an example [pull request](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/2415)
     Do not merge this until the switch is fully complete. Make sure you create enough
     processes to handle your load.
  2. Stop all pillows. You may have to be on above branch (for e.g. pillow-reorg)
  ```bash   
  cchq <env> fab stop_pillows --branch=pillow-reorg
  ```
  3. Run below django management command to create checkpoints for new pillows.
  ```bash   
  cchq <env> django-manage create_checkpoints_for_merged_pillows
  ```
  You can pass `--check` option to dry-run.
  4. Deploy the change so that supervisor configuration is updated for the pillow switch.
  ```bash   
  cchq <env> ap deploy_commcarehq.yml --tags=services --limit=pillowtop --branch=pillow-reorg
  ```
  5. Run below command so that the supervisor process rereads the new config
  ```bash   
  cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs --branch=pillow-reorg
  ```
  6. Finally start all pillows.
  ```bash    
  cchq <env> fab start_pillows --branch=pillow-reorg
  ```

  You may do few checks to make sure the change is deployed succesfully.

  1. Do a `sudo supervisorctl status all` on all pillow machines and make sure that new pillows are running succesfully and old pillows are not.
  2. Look at pillow logs for new pillows and make sure there are no errors.
  3. Do basic QA of various change feeds like
     - Submit few forms, and make sure they appear in the UCR and standard reports
     - Create few mobile workers and make sure they are searchable in report filters
  4. Keep an eye on https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/256236/change-feeds-pillows

  At this point if all goes well, the above PR can be merged.

  If anything goes wrong beyond repair, the change can be rolled back, by following
  the all of above steps can be repeated using master branch instead of 
  your pillow-reorg branch (the third step can be skipped).
