title: Restart nginx after every letsencrypt cert auto-renewal
key: letsencrypt-restart-nginx
date: 2019-01-02

optional_per_env: yes

min_commcare_version:
max_commcare_version:

context: |
  Previously you had to manually restart nginx every time letsencrypt auto-renewed,
  which was about every two months.

details: |
  This migration applies an update to the cron job that triggers renewing the letsencrypt cert,
  that makes it also restart nginx directly after renewing.
  This makes the cert renewal process completely automatic
  so that staying on an up-to-date cert indefinitely
  should no longer require human intervention.

update_steps: |
  To apply, simply run
  ```
  commcare-cloud <env> ansible-playbook deploy_proxy.yml
  ```
  using the latest version of commcare-cloud.
  The change was introduced in https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/2532.
