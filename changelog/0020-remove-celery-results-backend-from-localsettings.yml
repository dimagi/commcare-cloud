context: |
  Upgrading to celery 4.x requires removing the dependency on
  django-celery, which means that its results backend will no
  longer be available.  This removes the django-celery backend
  as the default from localsettings, so the results backend can
  be specified by commcare-hq settings instead.

details: |
  If the localsettings change here is deployed prior to the
  minimum CommCare version, then celery will be missing its
  results backend.

  If celery is upgraded to 4.x prior to applying this change,
  celery will be misconfigured, using the unavailable
  django-celery results backend.

update_steps: |
  Update localsettings:
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud <env> update-config
  ```
