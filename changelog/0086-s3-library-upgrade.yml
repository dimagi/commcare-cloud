context: |
  The `botocore` library is being upgraded in CommCare HQ. A blob db
  configuration change may be necessary prior to deploying the new version.

details: |
  If you use Amazon S3 for blob storage and you use a bucket outside of
  `us-east-1` you will need to change the endpoint URL in your environment
  configuration before the botocore dependency of CommCare HQ is upgraded to or
  beyond 1.28.0.

update_steps: |
  Update `s3_blob_db_url` in your environment's `public.yml` file to the
  region-specific URL where your blob db bucket resides. For example, if your
  AWS region is `ap-south-1` then you should change the URL from
  `https://s3.amazonaws.com` to `https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`.

  See https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/pull/6504/files for an example
  of how to make this change.

  After making this change in your environment file, run the following command
  to roll it out with commcare-cloud.

  ```sh
  cchq <env> update-config
  ```

  The changes will be applied on the next deploy. If you wish to apply them
  immediately, run the following command.

  ```sh
  cchq <env> service commcare restart
  ```
