  Prepare for and migrate Repeat Records from Couch to SQL.

details: |
  This is an optional procedure that should be done if you use data forwarding
  and want to ensure a future deploy is not blocked on needing to perform manual
  migration steps.

update_steps: |
  Run the following command to determine how many repeat records you have to
  migrate (in all commands below, replace `<env>` with your environment name):

  ```sh
  cchq <env> django-manage shell -c '
  from corehq.motech.repeaters.management.commands.populate_repeatrecords import count_docs;
  print("Records to migrate:", count_docs())'
  ```

  The output should include something like the following:

  ```
  Records to migrate: 125011
  ```

  A future deploy will be blocked, requiring manual migration steps, if the
  number of records to migrate is more than 1000. These steps can be skipped
  and the migration will be performed automatically during a future deploy if
  the number is less than 1000 (as counted at deployment time). It is safe and
  recommended to perform these steps even if the number is less than 1000.

  Before proceeding, **make a full backup of your CommCare HQ data**. [Backup
  procedures](https://commcare-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backups_dr/2-backups-guide.html)
  are outside the scope of this document.

  Next, estimate the amount of free space that will be required for new data in
  PostgreSQL (main or repeaters database, depending on configuration):

  ```sh
  cchq <env> django-manage shell -c '
  from corehq.motech.repeaters.models import RepeatRecord;
  size = RepeatRecord.get_db().info()["sizes"]["active"];
  mult = int((int.bit_length(size) - 1) / 10);
  unit = " kMGT"[mult].strip();
  print(f"Couch DB file size: {size / (1024 ** mult):.2f} {unit}B")'
  ```

  The output will include something like:

  ```
  Couch DB file size: 8.33 GB
  ```

  Ensure there is at least 1.5 to 2 times that amount of free space available on
  the machine hosting the main PostgreSQL database in your environment. That is,
  unless you have configured CommCare HQ to store repeaters in a separate
  database, in which case the extra space should be available to the repeaters
  database.

  Run the following commands to perform the migration.

  ```sh
  # Create a private release in which to run management commands.
  # Make a note of the release directory path.
  cchq <env> deploy commcare --private --keep-days=30

  # Start a screen session
  cchq <env> ssh django_manage -t screen -S couch2sql

  # If the connection drops, reconnect with
  cchq <env> ssh django_manage -t screen -x couch2sql

  # In the screen session
  sudo -iu cchq
  mkdir ~/couch2sql
  cd <private-release-directory-path>  # created above

  # Run the migration command
  ./manage.py populate_repeatrecords --log-path ~/couch2sql
  # Re-run this command until it completes successfully (exit code 0).

  # After successful completion, run again with --fixup-diffs=... if directed
  # to do so by command output.
  ```

  DO NOT delete repeat records from Couch DB yet, they are still needed! A
  future change log entry will instruct when it is safe to to that.

  If you do not want to migrate historical repeat records from Couch you can
  make it appear as if the migration has completed without actually migrating
  anything. Use the following command to do that:

  ```sh
  # WARNING do not do this unless you want to discard repeat records in Couch
  cchq <env> django-manage populate_repeatrecords --override-is-migration-completed yes
  ```
