context: |
  We've remove the PARSER_CLASS when configuring redis in settings.py.

details: |
  The PARSER_CLASS setting when configuring redis is unnecessary and we've opted to remove it
  to ensure future compatibility with the redis python client library.

  The line being removed is:
    'PARSER_CLASS': 'redis.connection.HiredisParser'

  While not recommended, if you have specified a different parser than HiredisParser, you will
  be responsible for supporting it once commcare-hq upgrades the redis python library version in use.

update_steps: |
  Just run `update-config`.
  1. cchq <env> update-config
