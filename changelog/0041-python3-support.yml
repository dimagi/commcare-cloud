context: |
  Python 3.6 is supported and now the preferred version to use. In anticipation
  of dropping Python 2 support, an error will be displayed when running commands
  with Python 2. Instructions for upgrading to Python 3 are provided in the
  error message. An option is provided to temporarily revert to Python 2 (see
  update steps for details).

  Python 2 support will end on 2021-03-04.

details: |
  Pip versions greater than 21.0 are not compatible with Python 2. To avoid
  dependency issues, we urge you to upgrade your environment to Python 3.6 as
  soon as possible. Python 2 should only serve as a backup if any issues are
  encountered while using Python 3.

update_steps: |
  To setup Python 3.6, see
  https://commcare-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/1-commcare-cloud/1-installation.html#manual-installation

  If you encounter a problem using Python 3, you can temporarily revert back to
  Python 2 by activating a Python 2 virtualenv and appending this option to your
  command: `--force-commcare-cloud-to-use-python2`.

  Ensure your Python 2 virtualenv is setup properly with these commands:
  - Activate Python-2.7-based virtualenv (create if necessary)
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run `pip install -e .`
  - Run `rm src/commcare_cloud.egg-info/requires.txt`
  - Run `manage-commcare-cloud install`
