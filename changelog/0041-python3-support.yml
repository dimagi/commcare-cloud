context: |
  Python 3 is supported and now the preferred version to use. In anticipation of dropping Python 2 support,
  an error will be genereated if running commands with Python 2. Instructions for upgrading to Python 3,
  as well as continuing to use Python 2 are provided in the error message.

details: |
  Pip versions greater than 21.0 are not compatible with Python 2. To avoid dependency issues,
  we urge you to upgrade your environment to Python 3 as soon as possible. Python 2 should only
  serve as a backup if any issues are encountered while using Python 3.

update_steps: |
  Setup Python 3
  - Create a new Python-3-based virtualenv (3.6 recommended)
  - Run `pip install -r requirements3.txt`
  - Run `rm -rf src/commcare_cloud.egg-info`
  - Run `pip install -e .`
  - Run `manage-commcare-cloud install`

  To use Python 2, append this flag to your command:
  `--force-commcare-cloud-to-use-python2`
