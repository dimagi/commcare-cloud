context: |
  Copy data from `supply_point` field to `location` field in `Invitation` model to prevent errors with
  future migrations to the `users_invitation` table.

  This operation is required for all environments regardless of feature usage.

details: |
  In the `Invitation` model, the `supply_point` field will be replaced by a foreign key reference
  to `SQLLocation`. This migration is to prepare for that transition.

update_steps: |
  Execute the following command:

  ```shell
  $ commcare-cloud <env> django-manage --tmux copy_invitation_supply_point
  ```

  Precautions:
  * No downtime is needed for this operation however it is best to run the command during a period
    of low traffic.
