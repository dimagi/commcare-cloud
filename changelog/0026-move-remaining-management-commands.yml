context: |
  This change requires editing `app-processes.yml` to add some of processes to the `management_comamnds`
  section

details: |
  To standardize how we deploy all management command processes we have changed the remaining management commands
  to use the same process as the others. The following commands used to be automatically deployed as part of the
  pillowtop processes and would always be deployed onto the first host in the `pillowtop` group. From now on they
  will be deployed as configured by the `management_commands` section in `app-processes.yml`.

  * run_pillow_retry_queue

update_steps: |
  1. Add the above mentioned management command to the `management_commands` section of `app-processes.yml`:

  ```diff
    management_commands:
  +   pillowN:
  +     run_pillow_retry_queue:
  ```
  2. Run `cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs`
