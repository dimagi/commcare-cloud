title: Update `deploy` CommandArgs
key: update-deploy-args
date: 2020-02-28
optional_per_env: no
min_commcare_version:
max_commcare_version:
context: |
  We are adding support for deploying from a specific commit hash or tag, replacing
  the deploy command's `commcare-branch` argument with a more general `commcare-rev` argument.

details: |
  We previously supported deploying only from named branches. This change enables more control
  over which code is deployed for users who do not have the ability to create branches.

update_steps: |
  The only change you need to make is to replace any usage of
  `commcare-cloud <env> fab deploy --commcare-branch=BRANCH` with
  `commcare-cloud <env> fab deploy --commcare-rev=BRANCH`.
