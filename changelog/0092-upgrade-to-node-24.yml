  Node.js 20.x LTS is reaching its end of life 30th April 2026, so node and npm must be upgraded on all machines.

details: |
  Because the current LTS version we are using of Node.js (20.x) is reaching its end of life on the 30th of April 2026,
  we are upgrading Node.js to the current LTS version 24.11. As npm is tightly-coupled with node, we are also upgrading npm to 11.6.x.

update_steps: |
  To upgrade node.js and npm on your machines please run:
  ```bash
  cchq <env> deploy-stack --tags=npm
  ```
