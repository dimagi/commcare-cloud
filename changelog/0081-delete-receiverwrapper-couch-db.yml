  Optional: Delete unused forwarding data from Couch.

details: |
  This is an optional procedure that may be done if you use data forwarding and
  want to free up space used by old forwarding data that has been migrated to
  SQL. The procedure is optional because the data will automatically be removed
  in the future, approximately 3 months from the release date of this change
  log.

update_steps: |
  Run the following commands:

  ```sh
  cchq <env> django-manage --tmux delete_couch_dbs --dbname=receiverwrapper
  ```

  Read and answer the prompts carefully. The command will show what will be
  done, but will not actually delete the database. After it completes, in the
  same tmux session run the following command and follow the prompts to delete
  the database:

  ```sh
  ./manage.py delete_couch_dbs --dbname=receiverwrapper --commit
  ```

  Exit the tmux session after the command completes.
