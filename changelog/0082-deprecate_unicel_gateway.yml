context: |
  This is a notice specifically for projects with Unicel configured as an SMS gateway, which is no longer functional.
  Projects that do not have Unicel configured do not need to take any action.

details: |
  Starting June 1st, 2020, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued a change in SMS regulations that
  restricts SMS gateways to sending only pre-approved template messages. Given the flexible nature of CommCare Messaging,
  which allows users to configure custom SMSs, this change has made it challenging for us to continue operating the UNICEL
  gateway effectively in India. Therefore, effective August 24, 2024, the UNICEL gateway will no longer be available as an
  option under the SMS Connectivity page:

update_steps: |
  As mentioned projects that do not have UNICEL configured do not need to take any action. Likewise, projects that do not use or
  plan to use messaging do not need to take any action. After the deprecation data, projects with Unicel configured as the only
  gateway will default to having no SMS provider.
