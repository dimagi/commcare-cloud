  Populate a new field for all Data Forwarders (repeaters).

  This is optional, but is recommended to do for all environments where Data Forwarders are being used. A migration
  will be added in the future, which will automatically apply these changes during a code deploy if they have not
  yet been applied. If there are many Data Forwarders, it will slow down the deploy process.

details: |
  To prepare for a future change where we allow repeater names to be configurable, we have added a `name` field to
  the `repeaters_repeater` SQL table. In order to populate the field correctly for all existing repeaters we are
  running a data migration which will copy the name from the connection settings associated with the repeater.

  If this migration is not run manually it will be run during a future code deploy. We advise running it manually
  prior to that to prevent any issues or delays during code deploy.
  

update_steps: |
  To run the data migration, execute the following command:
  
  ```shell
  commcare-cloud <env> django-manage populate_repeater_names 
  ```
  
  Precautions:
  * No downtime is needed for this operation. However, it is best to run the command during a period
    of low traffic.
