# For testing the play that travis runs
#
# First run: ansible-playbook -i inventories/test-vagrant deploy_stack.yml -e '@vars/dev.yml' --tags=common,common_installs,commcarehq
#
# This fails part way through due to lessc (and it's fine to stop there). The
# extra tags (common and common_installs) are necessary to get git installed on
# the VM (it's already installed on the travis machine, which is why the
# vagrant run is slightly different).
#
# Then run: ansible-playbook -i inventories/test-vagrant deploy_stack.yml -e '@vars/dev.yml' --tags=commcarehq
#
# This should complete without errors.
