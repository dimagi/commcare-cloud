# Ansible deployment orchestration and configuration management

This repository represents a workable role for deploying a single new
"webworker" to a given stack for the commcare-hq application.

To test the role, a vagrant file has been added that will provide the required
servers for a multi-machine deployment similar to the US production stack
described in
[Dimagi devops needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQFDC56SU8N1M-1abDWpnQKti2zYroTPBC2EmeIM8SA/pub)

Begin by checkout out the source for this repostiory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dimagi/commcarehq-ansible
```

Then, change directories into the new clone and set up submodules:

```
$ cd commcarehq-ansible
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Ensure you have downloaded Vagrant and virtual box
If you needed to download virtual box, you should also download a box configuration:
```
vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
```

Then start vagrant:

```
$ vagrant up
```
If you run into issues starting vagrant, see the troubleshooting section at the bottom.

Once the vagrant cluster is done building, you may ssh into the control server
and run a full deployment:

```
$ vagrant ssh control
...
$ cd /vagrant/ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/development -e '@vars/dev.yml' deploy_stack.yml
```

This will build a database server, a proxy server and a single web worker,
hooked into both appropriately.

**NOTE**

After executing the `ansible-playbook` command you may run into an error that looks like this:

```
GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
fatal: [192.168.33.16] => SSH encountered an unknown error during the connection. We recommend you re-run the command using -vvvv, which will enable SSH debugging output to help diagnose the issue
```

This means that you have run afoul of an intermittent bug in the vagrant provisioning system with regard to external provisioning scripts, ssh and Ubuntu 12.04.  The solution is to manually cat the appropriate public key onto the vagrant user's `authorized_hosts` file:

```
echo control app1 app2 proxy1 db1 | xargs -n1 -J% vagrant ssh % -c 'sudo cat /vagrant/provisioning/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```


Once the preliminary deployment is complete, a new web worker may be added
simply by editing the file `ansible/inventories/development.yml` and adding the second
web worker server IP address. Also uncomment the section of the vagrant file that refers to 'app2':

```ini
[webworkers]
192.168.33.15
192.168.33.18
```

In order to have this set up send email without crashing
(which you need to do during a deploy, for example)
run a debug smtp server daemon on control:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh control
...
$ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer 0.0.0.0:1025
```

### Troubleshooting

`vagrant up` fails.
* Start VirtualBox `$ VirtualBox`
  * Or on a Mac, `$ sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart`
* Attempt to start the VM
  * If the error message is: `VT-x needs to be enabled in BIOS`
For the Lenovo T440s: 
  * Restart machine, press Enter during startup
  * Navigate to Security -> Virtualization
    * Turn both settings on


### Running only parts of the playbook

- Update localsettings:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventories/development -e '@vars/dev.yml'  deploy_stack.yml --tags=localsettings
  ```
- Skip the common setup, including apt installs and updating the commcarehq code:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventories/development -e '@vars/dev.yml'  deploy_stack.yml --skip-tags=common
  ```

Tags available:

- apache2
- aptcache
- common
- deploy
- git
- keystore
- ksplice
- localsettings
- newrelic
- slow

Note: to generate this list automatically, you can run something like

```bash
ansible-playbook -u root -i ../../commcare-hq/fab/inventory/india deploy_stack.yml -e "@../config/india/india.yml" --tags= | sed 's/ERROR: tag(s) not found in playbook: .  possible values: //g' | sed 's/,/\
/g' | xargs -I% echo - %
```


### Provisioning build servers (experimental)

For a stripped down setup that's only enough to run the test suite, use the following:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i ../buildservers deploy_buildservers.yml --skip-tags=node_installs
```
