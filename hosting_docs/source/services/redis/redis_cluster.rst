Redis Cluster
=============

commcare-cloud supports setting up Redis as a monolith or as a cluster. Setting up monolith is simple and is in built in the full stack deploy. Simply add the host to ``redis`` host group in the inventory. Setting up a cluster is not fully automated in commcare-cloud and there are few additional steps required. This document explains how to setup Redis cluster.

How to setup a Redis cluster
----------------------------

Redis requires at least three master nodes for a functional cluster. Read more on Redis cluster tutorial `documentation <[https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial>`_\ ) to understand other requirements and limitations of Redis cluster. Redis cluster supports Redis master slave model, but commcare-cloud supports running Redis cluster with master nodes only. To setup Redis cluster using commcare-cloud, follow below steps


* Add Redis hosts under inventory groups ``redis`` and ``redis_cluster_master``
* Run below to install Redis on the three nodes with cluster specific config
  .. code-block::

     commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --limit=<redis_hosts> --tags=redis

* On any one of the nodes, run below command to make the Redis hosts form a cluster with equal number of hash slots on each node (aka shards)
  .. code-block::

      /usr/local/src/redis-4.0.8/src/redis-trib.rb create --replicas 0 <list of redis URLs of all hosts in the format redis_ip:redis_port>

Note that this creates a fresh Redis cluster with no data. It is also possible to migrate an existing Redis monolith with data to a Redis cluster. This document doesn't go into details on that, but the general process involves below steps


* Setting up an empty redis cluster
* Resharding the cluster to have one node contain all hash slots instead of equal distribution
* Getting data dump from old Redis instance in aof or rdb format
* Restore the dump to the new node that has all slots
* Reshard the new cluster to equally distribute hash slots

How to expand the cluster by adding a master node
-------------------------------------------------

Redis cluster can be expanded by adding more master nodes and resharding existing data. This can be done live while Redis cluster continues to serve requests, so a downtime may not be necessary. Below are the steps to expand a Redis cluster.


* Add the new Redis node under the host group ``redis_cluster_master`` and run below command to install Redis on this node
  .. code-block::

     commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --limit=<new_redis_host> --tags=redis

* Run below command  to add the node to the existing cluster. Run it on a redis host that is already part of the cluster 
  .. code-block::

       /usr/local/src/redis-4.0.8/src/redis-trib.rb add-node <new_redis_host:redis_port> <existing_redis_host_ip>:<redis_port>

* Run below command in a tmux to reshard the data which should take few minutes to complete.
  .. code-block::

     ./redis-trib.rb rebalance --use-empty-masters <existing_redis_host_ip>:<redis_port>
