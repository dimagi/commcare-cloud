Slack Notifications from CommCare Cloud
=======================================

commcare-cloud can be configured to send event notifications to Slack such as
pre and post deploy messages.

To configure commcare-cloud to send messages to Slack:


#. 
   Create a `Slack app <https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics>`_ and copy the
   access token.

   The app  will require the following authentication scopes:


   #. channels:join
   #. chat:write
   #. reactions:write

#. 
   Set the access token as a commcare-cloud secret:

    Run the following command and paste in the token when prompted:

   .. code-block:: shell

       commcare-cloud <env> secrets edit slack_token

#. 
   Set the value of ``slack_notifications_channel`` in the environment ``meta.yml`` file. This
   should be the ID of the Slack channel to send notifications to.

   .. code-block:: yml

       slack_notifications_channel: "C0WLJ3XYZ"

   To get the ID you can open the channel in a web browser and copy the ID from the URL:

   .. code-block::

      https://app.slack.com/client/.../C0WLJ3XYZ
