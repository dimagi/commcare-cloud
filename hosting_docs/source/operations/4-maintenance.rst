Expectations for Ongoing Maintenance
====================================

Like any software project, CommCare HQ requires active maintenance to be
kept up-to-date. As project maintainers, Dimagi frequently makes changes
such as library upgrades, bug fixes, feature development, database
migrations, and infrastructure improvements. Whenever possible, these
changes are made to be rolled out automatically with a regular deploy,
but occasional larger changes require direct handling to minimize
disruptions.

To minimize friction, we recommend that anyone hosting an instance of
CommCare HQ commit to keeping their environment up to date by following
the guidelines described on this page. It can become much more
challenging to update an environment that has been neglected for an
extended period.

Monitor the developers forum
----------------------------

Subscribe to the `developers forum <https://forum.dimagi.com/c/developers/5>`_ to keep in contact with Dimagi and
other parties hosting CommCare. Dimagi will announce important changes
there, such as upcoming upgrades.

Deploy CommCare HQ at least once every two weeks
------------------------------------------------

CommCare HQ is under continuous development, so to ensure you are
running an up-to-date version of the code, you should be deploy changes
at least every two weeks.

Some code changes are meant to be rolled out over the course of two or
three deploys, which allows us to minimize or eliminate the disruptions
caused by things like backwards-incompatible database changes. It is
important for the developers to be able to make assumptions about how
these changes will impact existing environments.

Update commcare-cloud before every deploy and check the changelog
-----------------------------------------------------------------

``commcare-cloud`` is developed in conjunction with CommCare HQ. To be
on the safe side, it's best to update just before deploying CommCare HQ.
When you do so, check for new entries in the `changelog <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-cloud/blob/master/docs/changelog/index.md>`_, which should
alert you of any new changes which might require you to take action. We
recommend you take a look through the current entries to get an idea of
what these changes might look like.

Take the action described in each new changelog entry within the
compatibility window, if applicable. Aside from urgent security issues,
there should be a window during which you can plan for downtime or for a
more involved upgrade. If you will be unable to apply the change in the
window, please reach out on the forum.

After the window expires, Dimagi will drop support for the old version.
You may then face additional difficulty in deploying the change, as well
as incompatibility problems on your server.
