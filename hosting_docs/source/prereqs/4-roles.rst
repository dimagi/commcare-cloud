Roles And Responsibilities for Hosting CommCare
===============================================

------------
Introduction
------------

This section is intended to convey the different roles and
responsibilities which are associated with setting up and maintaining a
privately hosted local cloud instance of CommCare HQ, along with
expectations around what skills and knowledge are needed to fulfill
them. An individual person or firm may fulfill a number of these roles,
but they are separated here to clarify the skills and availability
required to fulfill them.

These are based directly on Dimagi’s process and experience providing
CommCare HQ as a managed SaaS platform and managed cloud, but they may
not be comprehensive depending on specific local or organizational
needs.
