Performance Benchmarking for CommCare HQ using Locust
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

Performance testing is useful to understand how well your CommCareHQ instance performs under a given load. The results of this testing will inform any bottlenecks in your setup and how to scale it for more number of users.

Dimagi uses `Locust <https://locust.io/>`_, and scripts stored in the
`commcare-perf repository <https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-perf/>`_,
for performance benchmarking apps on CommCare HQ.

The commcare-perf repository includes instructions for installing the
scripts.

See Locust's documentation for `running Locust in Docker`_.


Getting started
---------------

1. Start Locust with a web interface::

       (venv) $ locust -f locustfiles/form_submission.py

2. Open http://localhost:8089 in a browser.

3. You will be asked the number of users to simulate, and their spawn
   rate. Start with 1 user, at a spawn rate of 1 user per second, and
   click the "Start swarming" button.

4. Locust will show you a table of statistics. You can switch to the
   "Charts" tab to see requests per second, response times, and the
   number of simulated users.

5. Click "Stop" and increase the number of users to see how CommCare is
   affected.


Submitting your own forms
-------------------------

``locustfiles/form_submission.py`` uses three example form submissions
for testing. They are saved in the ``xforms/`` directory.

If you would like to use your own form submissions, you can find them in
CommCare.

1. Navigate to "Reports" > "Case List", and find a sample case with test
   data. (Do not use a real case.)

2. Select the case, and choose the "Case History" tab.

3. Select a form. (If you select the form that registered the case, you
   will get duplicate cases.)

4. Choose "Raw XML".

5. Copy and paste the XML into a file and save it in the ``xforms/``
   directory.

6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for as many forms as you wish to submit.

7. ``locustfiles/form_submission.py`` will submit all the files it finds
   in the ``xforms/`` directory. If you don't want to use the original
   examples, just delete them.

8. Restart Locust to test using your form submissions.


Saving results
--------------

In Locust, switch to the "Download Data" tab.

Here you can download the report, and various data in CSV format.
