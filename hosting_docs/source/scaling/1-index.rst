How to Scale
============

This section contains guides on how to test your CommCareHQ instance's performance and how to estimate sizing for higher number of users using a tool called `commcare_resource_model <http://github.com/dimagi/commcare_resource_model>`_.

The hardware requirements required for instances under 15,000 mobile users is given at :ref:`prereqs/5-requirements:Hardware requirements and Deployment Options`. This section is intended to provide information on how to scale CommCareHQ for projects going beyond 15,000 mobile users.
