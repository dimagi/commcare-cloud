# 66. remove-unused-elastic-settings

**Date:** 2022-12-13

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
CommCareHQ has two settings (`CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS` and
`ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`) that were created several years ago for tuning
Elasticsearch in a specific environment which no longer exists. This change
removes support for those settings and the application logic that existed for
them. We do not expect this to impact any self-hosted environments, but it's
prudent to confirm.

## Details
If your environment references either of the following Django settings then
they will need to be removed:

- `CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS`
- `ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`

## Steps to update
Search your environment's public.yml `localsettings` section for
`CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS` and `ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL`. If present, they may
look something like this:

```yaml
localsettings:
  # ...
  CASE_ES_DROP_FORM_FIELDS: True
  ES_XFORM_DISABLE_ALL: True
```

If either of these values are present, remove them.
