# 65. Populate a new field for Data Forwarders

**Date:** 2022-12-13

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[ec13eacc](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/ec13eaccc55d14b708c4e25349edcfd6936fb4d1)


## Change Context
Populate a new field for all Data Forwarders (repeaters).

This is optional, but is recommended to do for all environments where Data Forwarders are being used. A migration
will be added in the future, which will automatically apply these changes during a code deploy if they have not
yet been applied. If there are many Data Forwarders, it will slow down the deploy process.

## Details
To prepare for a future change where we allow repeater names to be configurable, we have added a `name` field to
the `repeaters_repeater` SQL table. In order to populate the field correctly for all existing repeaters we are
running a data migration which will copy the name from the connection settings associated with the repeater.

If this migration is not run manually it will be run during a future code deploy. We advise running it manually
prior to that to prevent any issues or delays during code deploy.

## Steps to update
To run the data migration, execute the following command:

```shell
commcare-cloud <env> django-manage populate_repeater_names 
```

Precautions:
* No downtime is needed for this operation. However, it is best to run the command during a period
  of low traffic.
